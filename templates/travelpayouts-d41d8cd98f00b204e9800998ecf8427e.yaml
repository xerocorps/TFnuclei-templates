  description: The Travelpayouts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.16. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in the outdated Redux Framework. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to gain restricted access to administrative actions
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
