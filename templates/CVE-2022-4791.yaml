  description: The Product Slider and Carousel with Category for WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode
    in versions up to, and including, 2.7.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'design'. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level and above permissions
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page
