  description: 'The Product Table by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the saveGroup function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to modify product groups via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
