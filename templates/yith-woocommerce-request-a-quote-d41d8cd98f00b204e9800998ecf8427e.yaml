  description: The YITH Request a Quote for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the several functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and edit items to a session quote
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
