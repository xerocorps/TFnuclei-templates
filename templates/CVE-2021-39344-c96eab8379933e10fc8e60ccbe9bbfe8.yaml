  description: 'The KJM Admin Notices WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters
    found in the ~/admin/class-kjm-admin-notices-admin.php file which allowed attackers
    with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up
    to and including 2.0.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html
    is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
