  description: 'The Product Time Countdown for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
