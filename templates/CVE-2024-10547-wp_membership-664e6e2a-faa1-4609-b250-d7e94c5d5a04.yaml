  description: 'The WP Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the user_profile_image_upload()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
