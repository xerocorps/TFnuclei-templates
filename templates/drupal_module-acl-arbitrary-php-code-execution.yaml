  description: 'The ACL module, short for Access Control Lists, is an API for other
    modules to create lists of users and give them access to nodes. The module processes
    user input in a way that could be unsafe. This can lead to Remote Code Execution
    via Object Injection. As this is an API module, it is only exploitable if a client
    module exposes the vulnerability. Details of some contributed client modules are
    given below. Custom modules using ACL could also expose the vulnerability. This
    vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker typically needs an admin-type
    permission provided by one of ACLs client modules. Known client modules include:  Forum
    Access Flexi Access Content Access  Coordinated Security Advisories are being
    released for those client modules that have  Security coverage.'
