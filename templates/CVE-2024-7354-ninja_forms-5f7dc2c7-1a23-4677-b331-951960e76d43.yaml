  description: "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to\
    \ the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in versions\
    \ 3.8.6 to 3.8.10. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a\
    \ user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
