  description: The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to invoke them and execute actions on behalf of administrators,
    via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
