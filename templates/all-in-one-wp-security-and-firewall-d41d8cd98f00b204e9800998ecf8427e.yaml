  description: The All In One WP Security & Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the tab parameter in versions up to, and
    including 4.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in administrative pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
    Please note that this was only exploitable on older browsers at the time of disclosure.
