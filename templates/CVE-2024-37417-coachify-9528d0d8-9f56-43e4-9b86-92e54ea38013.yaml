  description: 'The Coachify theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the coachify_update_admin_notice() function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
