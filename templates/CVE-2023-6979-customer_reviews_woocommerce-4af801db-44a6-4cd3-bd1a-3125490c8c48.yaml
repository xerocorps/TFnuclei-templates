  description: 'The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ivole_import_upload_csv
    AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 5.38.9. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
