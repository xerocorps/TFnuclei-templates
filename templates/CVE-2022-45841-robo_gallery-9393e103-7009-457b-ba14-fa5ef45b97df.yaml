  description: 'The Robo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up
    to, and including, 3.2.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level permissions and above, to create articles, list posts, activate
    and deactivate addons and reset gallery view counts. Furthermore, several of these
    AJAX actions were missing Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection.
