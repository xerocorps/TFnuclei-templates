  description: "The Quiz and Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary\
    \ file uploads due to missing filename sanitization in the qsm_upload_image_fd_question()\
    \ function in versions up to, and including, 7.0.1. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server\
    \ using a double extension attack method which may make remote code execution\
    \ possible on sites with a configuration that parse the first extension of a file.\
    \ \nThis is due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2020-35949.\n"
