  description: 'The Blog Designer PRO for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.7. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
    to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution
    of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
    sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be
    uploaded and included.
