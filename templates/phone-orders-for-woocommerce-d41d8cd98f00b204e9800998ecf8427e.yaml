  description: The Phone Orders for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.7.1. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on the ajax_gate function which controls many
    additional functions also missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function and perform actions on behalf
    of administrators, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
