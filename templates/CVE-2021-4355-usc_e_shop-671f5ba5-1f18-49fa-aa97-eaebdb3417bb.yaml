  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to missing capability checks on the download_orderdetail_list(), change_orderlist(),
    and download_member_list() functions called via admin_init hooks in versions up
    to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to download lists of members, products and orders.
