  description: "The Store Locator for WordPress with Google Maps \u2013 LotsOfLocales\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.98.10. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
