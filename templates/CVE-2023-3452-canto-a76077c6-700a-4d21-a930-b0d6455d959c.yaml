  description: 'The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion
    in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 via the ''wp_abspath'' parameter. This
    allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code
    on the server, provided that allow_url_include is enabled. Local File Inclusion
    is also possible, albeit less useful because it requires that the attacker be
    able to upload a malicious php file via FTP or some other means into a directory
    readable by the web server.
