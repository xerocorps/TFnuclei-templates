  description: 'The Blocksy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via headers/footers in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.19 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
