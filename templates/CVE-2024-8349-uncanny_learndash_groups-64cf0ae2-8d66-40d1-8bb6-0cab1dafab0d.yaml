  description: 'The Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0.1. This is
    due to the plugin not properly restricting what users a group leader can edit.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group leader-level access
    and above, to change admin account email addresses which can subsequently lead
    to admin account access.
