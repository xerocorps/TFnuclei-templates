  description: The Email Subscription Popup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via several GET parameters such as 'entrant' in
    versions up to, and including, 1.2.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
