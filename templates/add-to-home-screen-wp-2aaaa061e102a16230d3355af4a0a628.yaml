  description: "The Add to home screen WP Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters including the \u2018message\u2019\
    \ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only\
    \ affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has\
    \ been disabled."
