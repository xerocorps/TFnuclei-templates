  description: 'Apache Spark UI is susceptible to remote command injection. ACLs can
    be enabled via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication
    filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the
    application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow
    impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. An attacker can potentially
    reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command
    based on input and execute it, resulting in arbitrary shell command execution.
    Affected versions are 3.0.3 and earlier, 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized
    access, data leakage, and potential compromise of the entire system.
