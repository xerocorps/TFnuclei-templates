  description: 'The BuddyPress XProfile Custom Image Field plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
