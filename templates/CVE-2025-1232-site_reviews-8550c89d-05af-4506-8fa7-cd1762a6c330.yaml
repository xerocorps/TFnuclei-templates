  description: 'The Site Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.4 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
