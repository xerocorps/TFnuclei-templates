  description: "The Age Gate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local PHP File\
    \ Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.3 via the 'lang' parameter.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute\
    \ arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of code in those files.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included.\n"
