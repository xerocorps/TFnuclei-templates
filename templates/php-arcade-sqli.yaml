  description: 'A vulnerability was found in Jcink PHP-Quick-Arcade 3.0.21 (Programming
    Language Software). It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects
    an unknown code of the file Arcade.php. The manipulation of the argument id with
    an unknown input leads to a sql injection vulnerability. The CWE definition for
    the vulnerability is CWE-89. The software constructs all or part of an SQL command
    using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not
    neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended
    SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
