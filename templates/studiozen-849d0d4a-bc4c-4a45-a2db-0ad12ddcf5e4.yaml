  description: 'The StudioZen Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer in all known versions.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
