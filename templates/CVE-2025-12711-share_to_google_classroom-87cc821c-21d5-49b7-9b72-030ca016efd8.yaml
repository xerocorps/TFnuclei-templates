  description: 'The Share to Google Classroom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the share_to_google shortcode in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
