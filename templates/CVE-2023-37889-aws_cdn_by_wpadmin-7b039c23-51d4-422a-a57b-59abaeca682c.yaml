  description: 'The WPAdmin AWS CDN plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.13. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on several functions called via AJAX actions in the /admin/class-aws-cdn-admin.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several
    unauthorized actions like managing cdn, certificate, domain, and exclusion settings
    for the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
