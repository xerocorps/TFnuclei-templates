  description: 'The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    6.12.27. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ecwid_deactivate_feedback()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send deactivation
    messages on behalf of a site owner via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
