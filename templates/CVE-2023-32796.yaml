  description: 'The WooCommerce Product Enquiry plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Self-Cross-Site Scripting via the enquiry form fields in versions up to, and
    including, 2.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in the page an enquiry form is on, though it would require successful social engineering
    to get the user to input the malicious payload into form fields.
