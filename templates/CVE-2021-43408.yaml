  description: The 'Duplicate Post' WordPress plugin up to and including version 1.1.9
    is vulnerable to SQL Injection. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when client
    supplied data is included within an SQL Query insecurely. SQL Injection can typically
    be exploited to read, modify and delete SQL table data. In many cases it also
    possible to exploit features of SQL server to execute system commands and/or access
    the local file system. This particular vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated
    user who has been granted access to use the Duplicate Post plugin. By default,
    this is limited to Administrators, however the plugin presents the option to permit
    access to the Editor, Author, Contributor and Subscriber roles.
