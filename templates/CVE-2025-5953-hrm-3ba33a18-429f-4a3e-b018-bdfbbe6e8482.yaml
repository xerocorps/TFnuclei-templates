  description: 'The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization in the ajax_insert_employee()
    and update_empoyee() functions in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The AJAX handler
    reads the client-supplied $_POST[''role''] and, after basic cleaning via hrm_clean(),
    passes it directly to wp_insert_user() and later to $user->set_role() without
    verifying that the current user is allowed to assign that role. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to
    elevate their privileges to administrator.
