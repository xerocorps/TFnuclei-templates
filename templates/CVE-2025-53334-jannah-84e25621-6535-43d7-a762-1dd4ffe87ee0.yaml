  description: "The Jannah theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to, and excluding, 7.5.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the\
    \ execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
