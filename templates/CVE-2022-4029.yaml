  description: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions
    up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as
    it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.
