  description: 'The WP Live Chat Support Pro plugin through 8.0.26 for WordPress contains
    an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. This results from an incomplete patch
    for CVE-2018-12426. Arbitrary file upload is achieved by using a non-blacklisted
    executable file extension in conjunction with a whitelisted file extension, and
    prepending "magic bytes" to the payload to pass MIME checks. Specifically, an
    unauthenticated remote user submits a crafted file upload POST request to the
    REST api remote_upload endpoint. The file contains data that will fool the plugin''s
    MIME check into classifying it as an image (which is a whitelisted file extension)
    and finally a trailing .phtml file extension.
