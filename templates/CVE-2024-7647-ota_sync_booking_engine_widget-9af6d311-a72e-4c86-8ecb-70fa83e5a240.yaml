  description: 'The OTA Sync Booking Engine Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the otasync_widget_settings_fnc()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s
    settings and inject malicious scripts via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
