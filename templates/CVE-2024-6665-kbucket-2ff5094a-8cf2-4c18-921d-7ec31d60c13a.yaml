  description: 'The KBucket: Your Curated Content in WordPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''yt_apikey'' parameter in
    all versions up to, and including, 4.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
    installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
