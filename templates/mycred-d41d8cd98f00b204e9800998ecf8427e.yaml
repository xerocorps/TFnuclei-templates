  description: "The myCred \u2013 Points, Rewards, Gamification, Ranks, Badges & Loyalty\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 2.4.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link."
