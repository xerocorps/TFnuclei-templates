  description: 'The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
    Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.33.0 via the ''trx_sc_reviews''
    shortcode ''type'' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary
    files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
    can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
    execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included.
