  description: 'Multiple plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s bundled Featherlight.js JavaScript library (versions
    1.7.13 to 1.7.14) in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
