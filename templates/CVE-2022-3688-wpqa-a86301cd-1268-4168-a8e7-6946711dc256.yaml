  description: 'The WPQA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, but not including, 5.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on some of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to invoke these functions leading users to follow or unfollow others,
    via forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
