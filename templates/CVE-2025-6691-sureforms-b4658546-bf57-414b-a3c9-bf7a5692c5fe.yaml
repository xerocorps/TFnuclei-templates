  description: "The SureForms \u2013 Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file\
    \ path validation in the delete_entry_files() function in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution\
    \ when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
