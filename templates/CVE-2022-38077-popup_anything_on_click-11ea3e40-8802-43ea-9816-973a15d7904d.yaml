  description: 'The WP OnlineSupport, Essential Plugin Popup Anything plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    2.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the popupaoc_register_settings()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin''s
    settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
