  description: "The Carousel, Slider, Gallery by WP Carousel \u2013 Image Carousel\
    \ with Lightbox & Photo Gallery, Video Slider, Post Carousel & Post Grid, Product\
    \ Carousel & Product Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.8 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\
    \ This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html\
    \ has been disabled.\n"
