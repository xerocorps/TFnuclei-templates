  description: 'The Avada (Fusion) Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.12 via the handle_clone_post()
    function and the ''fusion_blog'' shortcode and due to insufficient restrictions
    on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected,
    private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
