  author: Bishopfox
  description: The Permissions by Term module extends Drupal by adding functionality
    for restricting access to single nodes via taxonomy terms. The module grants access
    to nodes that are being blocked by other node access modules and that the Permissions
    by Term module does not intend to control. Additionally, it grants access to unpublished
    nodes in node listings to users who should not be able to see them. These problems
    lead to an access bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the
    fact that it only occurs on sites that either have another node access module
    (besides Permissions by Term) in use, or that have node listings that are accessible
    to unprivileged users and that dont directly filter out unpublished content.
