  description: The imagecache actions module defines a number of additional image
    effects that can be used to create image styles. The Image styles admin sub module
    provides additional functionality to duplicate, export and import image styles.
    The module uses unserialize() to import image styles into another site where unserialize()
    is known to have security issues when processing potentially unsafe input. This
    vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the Image styles admin sub module
    must be enabled and an attacker must have a role with the permission administer
    image styles. Furthermore, the import functionality supports PHP code included
    in image effects as part of an image style, which would run on image derivative
    generation subject to the PHP module being enabled. This is intended behaviour
    for the Image styles admin sub module, but the user access restrictions should
    reflect the potential risks involved. The new security release of this module
    introduces a new import image styles permission which is marked as restricted.
    In order to use the image style import functionality, users will need to have
    a role which has this new permission in addition to administer image styles (which
    is not marked as restricted).
