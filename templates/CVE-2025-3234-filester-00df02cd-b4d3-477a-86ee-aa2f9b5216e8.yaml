  description: "The File Manager Pro \u2013 Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.8.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the\
    \ affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Administrators\
    \ have the ability to extend file manager usage privileges to lower-level users\
    \ including subscribers, which would make this vulnerability more severe on such\
    \ sites.\n"
