  description: The function update_shipment_status_email_status_fun in the plugin
    Advanced Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce in versions up to 3.2.6 is vulnerable
    to authenticated arbitrary options update. The function allows attackers (including
    those at customer level) to update any WordPress option in the database. Version
    3.2.5 was initially released as a fix, but doesn't fully address the issue.
