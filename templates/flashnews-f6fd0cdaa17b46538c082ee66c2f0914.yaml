  description: 'The Flash News Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
    in all versions due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of TimThumb. This makes
    it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s
    browser. The plugin is also vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload, Denial of Service
    Attacks, and Full Path Disclosure. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible, deny availability to legitimate users, and read
    sensitive information such as the full path of the WordPress installation.
