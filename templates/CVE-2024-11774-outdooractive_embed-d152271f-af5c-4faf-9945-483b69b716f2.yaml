  description: 'The Outdooractive Embed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''list2go'' shortcode in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
