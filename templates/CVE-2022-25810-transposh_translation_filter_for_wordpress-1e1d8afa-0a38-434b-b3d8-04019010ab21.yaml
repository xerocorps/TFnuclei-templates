  description: 'The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions
    called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9.1. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions and
    above to perform many administrative actions such as initiating new back-ups,
    modifying the plugin''s settings, deleting duplicates, and more.
