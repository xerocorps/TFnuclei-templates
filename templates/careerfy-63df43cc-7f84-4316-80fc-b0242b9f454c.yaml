  description: 'The Careerfy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
