  description: 'The Add Admin CSS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path
    Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1.  This is due to the plugin
    utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web
    application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed
    is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for
    damage to an affected website.
