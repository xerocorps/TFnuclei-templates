  description: "The Support Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File\
    \ Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server,\
    \ allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass\
    \ access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where\
    \ images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
