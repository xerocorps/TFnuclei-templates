  description: 'The Easy Email Subscription plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the show_editsub_page() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary subscribers
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
