  description: 'The Anih - Creative Agency WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up
    to, and including, 2024 due to an incomplete blacklist, insufficient input sanitization,
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
