    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The YSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.
    This is due to missing nonce verification on the content configuration page and
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via a forged
    request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link. The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
