  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-9529
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
    cvss-score: 5.1
  description: 'The Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to limited arbitrary function calls via the ''register_meta_box_cb'' and ''meta_box_cb''
    parameters in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.8 (excluding 6.3.6.2) due
    to insufficient input validation on those parameters. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary
    functions, like WordPress functions, in custom post types that will execute whenever
    a user accesses the injected post type. This can be leveraged to trick other users
    like administrators accessing posts into performing unauthorized actions through
    functions, and is not a very serious risk for the vast majority of site owners.
    Please follow the reference listed in this vulnerability record for instructions
    on how to update to the latest version of ACF that patches this issue and ensures
    accessibility to updates moving forward. Please note this issue was partially
    patched in 6.3.8 and 6.3.6.1 - 6.3.6.2, however, was hardened further in 6.3.6.3
    and 6.3.9.
