  description: 'The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.15. This is due to missing nonce validation
    in the ''crypto_connect_ajax_process::check'' function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such
    as an administrator via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
