  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-7415
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    cvss-score: 5.3
  description: 'The Remember Me Controls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full
    Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to the
    plugin allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has display_errors
    on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full
    path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information
    displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present
    for damage to an affected website.
