  description: 'The MP3 jPlayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to execute them, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
