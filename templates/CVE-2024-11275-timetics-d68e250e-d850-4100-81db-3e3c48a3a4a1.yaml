  description: 'The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online
    Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data
    due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/timetics/v1/customers/ REST
    API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.27. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Timetics Customer access and above, to delete
    arbitrary users.
