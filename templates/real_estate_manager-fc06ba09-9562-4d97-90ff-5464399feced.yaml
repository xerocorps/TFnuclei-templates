  description: "The Real Estate Manager \u2013 Property Listing and Agent Management\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the\
    \ \u2018revision\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to\
    \ insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link.\n"
