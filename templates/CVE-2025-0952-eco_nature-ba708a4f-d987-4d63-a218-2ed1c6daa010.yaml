  description: 'The Eco Nature - Environment & Ecology WordPress Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of
    service due to a missing capability check on the ''cmsmasters_hide_admin_notice''
    AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update
    option values to ''hide'' on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update
    an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate
    users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.
