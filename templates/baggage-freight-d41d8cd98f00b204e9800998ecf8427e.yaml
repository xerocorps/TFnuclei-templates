  description: The Baggage Freight Shipping Australia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload-package.php
    file in versions up to, and including, 0.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
