  description: 'The Auto Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''create_post_attachment_from_url''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
