  description: The Ultimate Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.6.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on various AJAX functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of tasks, such as deleting
    users and coupons, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
