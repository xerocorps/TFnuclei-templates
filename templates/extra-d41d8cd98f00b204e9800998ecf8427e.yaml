  description: 'The Elegant Themes Divi Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.17.2 in addition
    to the following themes: Divi <= 3.17.2 and Extra <= 2.17.2 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping in the post builder. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.'
