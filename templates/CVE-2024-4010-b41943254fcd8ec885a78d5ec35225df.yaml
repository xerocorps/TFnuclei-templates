  description: 'The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to
    a missing capability check on the handle_ajax_request function in all versions
    up to, and including, 5.7.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level access and above, to cause a loss of confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability, by performing multiple unauthorized actions. Some of these actions
    could also be leveraged to conduct PHP Object Injection and SQL Injection attacks.
