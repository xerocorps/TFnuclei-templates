  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Biography field featured on individual user profile pages due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that allows users to encode
    malicious web scripts with HTML encoding that is reflected back on the page. This
    affects versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. Please note this issue was only
    partially fixed in version 2.3.2.
