  description: 'The Manager for Icomoon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''upload'' function in
    versions up to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload zip files containing arbitrary files which will be extracted
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
