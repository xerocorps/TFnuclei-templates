  description: 'The Product Catalog Simple plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ic_system_status function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset product settings, delete products,
    delete product categories, delete old filters, and reassign product data via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
