  description: 'The Stock Ticker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in the ajax_stockticker_symbol_search_test function in versions up to,
    and including, 3.23.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
