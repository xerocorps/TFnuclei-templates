  description: 'The asMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.5.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level
    access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page.
