  description: 'The Ask Me theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, but not including, 6.8.7. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to invoke that function, via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
