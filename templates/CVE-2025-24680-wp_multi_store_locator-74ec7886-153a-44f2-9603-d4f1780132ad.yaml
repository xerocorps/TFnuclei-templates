  description: "The WP Multistore Locator \u2014 WP Store Locator Plugin: Effortless\
    \ Integration With Snazzy Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
