  description: 'The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''wpie_tempalte_import''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.28. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions
    granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s
    server which may make remote code execution possible.
