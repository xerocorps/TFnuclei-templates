  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar \u2014 Simply Schedule Appointments\
    \ Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via admin appointment settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.7.53\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations\
    \ where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
