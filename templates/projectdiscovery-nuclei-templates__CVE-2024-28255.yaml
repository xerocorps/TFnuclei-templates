  description: 'OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and
    governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless
    team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring
    and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request''s path is
    checked against this list. When the request''s path contains any of the excluded
    endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker
    may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example,
    a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111`
    will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with
    no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism
    and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to
    arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint
    uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and
    will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed
    in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.

  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized
    access to the OpenMetadata platform and its resources.
