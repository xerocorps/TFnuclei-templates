  description: 'The TZ PlusGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
    installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
