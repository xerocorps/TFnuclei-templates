  description: The N5 Upload Form WordPress plugin through 1.0 suffers from an arbitrary
    file upload issue in page where a Form from the plugin is embed, as any file can
    be uploaded. The uploaded filename might be hard to guess as it's generated with
    md5(uniqid(rand())), however, in the case of misconfigured servers with Directory
    listing enabled, accessing it is trivial.
