  description: "The \uC6B0\uCEE4\uBA38\uC2A4 \uB124\uC774\uBC84\uD398\uC774 plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's\
    \ mnp_purchase shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.7 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page.\n"
