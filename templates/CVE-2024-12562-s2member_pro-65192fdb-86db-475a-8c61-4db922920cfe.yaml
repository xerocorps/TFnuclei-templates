  description: 'The s2Member Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 241216 via deserialization of
    untrusted input from the ''s2member_pro_remote_op'' vulnerable parameter. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known
    POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via
    an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
    attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
