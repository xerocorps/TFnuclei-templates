    \ High Converting Stores For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page. This primarily affects multi-site installations and installations\
    \ where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
