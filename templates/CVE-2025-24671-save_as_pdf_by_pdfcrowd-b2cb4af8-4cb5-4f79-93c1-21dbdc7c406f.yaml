    cve-id: CVE-2025-24671
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The Save as PDF Plugin by Pdfcrowd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.0 via deserialization
    of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which
    means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing
    a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
    actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code
    depending on the POP chain present.
