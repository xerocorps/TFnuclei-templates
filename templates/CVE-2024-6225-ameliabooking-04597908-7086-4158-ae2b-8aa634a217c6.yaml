  description: "The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar \u2013 Amelia plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5 (and 7.5.1 for the Pro version)\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations\
    \ where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
