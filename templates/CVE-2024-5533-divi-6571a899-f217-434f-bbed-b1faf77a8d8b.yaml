  description: 'The Divi theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.25.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
