  description: 'Ensure that your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) user-managed service
    accounts are using GCP-managed keys instead of user-managed keys for authentication.
    For user-managed key pairs, key management operations such as key storage, key
    distribution, key revocation, key recovery, and key rotation, as well as key protection
    against unauthorized access, are your responsibilities.

    '
  impact: 'Using user-managed keys can lead to potential security risks such as unauthorized
    access if keys are not properly managed and secured.

    key management is handled by Google Cloud, thereby enhancing security and reducing
