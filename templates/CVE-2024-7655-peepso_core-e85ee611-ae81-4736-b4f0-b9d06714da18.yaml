  description: "The Community by PeepSo \u2013 Social Network, Membership, Registration,\
    \ User Profiles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will\
    \ execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site\
    \ installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
