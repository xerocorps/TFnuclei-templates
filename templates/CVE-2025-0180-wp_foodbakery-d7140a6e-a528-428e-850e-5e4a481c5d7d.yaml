  description: 'The WP Foodbakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.7. This is due to the plugin
    not properly restricting what user meta can be updated during profile registration.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register on the site as
    an administrator.
