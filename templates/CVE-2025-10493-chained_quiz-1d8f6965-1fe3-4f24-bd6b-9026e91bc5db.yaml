  description: 'The Chained Quiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct
    Object Reference in version 1.3.4 and below via the quiz submission and completion
    mechanisms due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to hijack and modify other users'' quiz attempts
    by manipulating the chained_completion_id cookie value, allowing them to alter
    quiz answers, scores, and results of any user. The vulnerability was partially
    patched in versions 1.3.4 and 1.3.5.
