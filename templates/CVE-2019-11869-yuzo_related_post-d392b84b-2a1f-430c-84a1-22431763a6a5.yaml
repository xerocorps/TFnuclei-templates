  description: 'The Yuzo Related Posts plugin 5.12.94 for WordPress has XSS because
    it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the request comes from an
    admin user (it actually only verifies that the request is for an admin page).
    An unauthenticated attacker can inject a payload into the plugin settings, such
    as the yuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.
