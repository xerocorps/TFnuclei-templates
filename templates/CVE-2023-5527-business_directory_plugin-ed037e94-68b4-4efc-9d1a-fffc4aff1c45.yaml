  description: 'The Business Directory Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 6.4.3 via the class-csv-exporter.php
    file. This allows authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above,
    to embed untrusted input into CSV files exported by administrators, which can
    result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local
    system with a vulnerable configuration.
