  description: 'The Library Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect
    in versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to insufficient validation
    on the redirect url supplied via the ''redirect_to'' parameter. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious
    sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
