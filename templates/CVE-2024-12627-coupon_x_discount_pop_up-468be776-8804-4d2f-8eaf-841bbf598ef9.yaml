  description: 'The Coupon X: Discount Pop Up, Promo Code Pop Ups, Announcement Pop
    Up, WooCommerce Popups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5 via deserialization of untrusted input
    from post content passed to the capture_email AJAX action. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject
    a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
    chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
    it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data,
    or execute code.
