  description: 'The College publisher Import WordPress plugin through 0.1 does not
    check for the uploaded CSV file to import, allowing high privilege users to upload
    arbitrary files, such as PHP, leading to RCE. Due to the lack of CSRF check, the
    issue could also be exploited via a CSRF attack.
