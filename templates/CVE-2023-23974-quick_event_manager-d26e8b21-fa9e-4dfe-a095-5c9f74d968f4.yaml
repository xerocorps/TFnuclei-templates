  description: 'The Quick Event Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 9.7.4. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on several calls in the qem_messages() function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to manage and alter registration settings
    that should be intended only for site administrators via a forged request, granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
