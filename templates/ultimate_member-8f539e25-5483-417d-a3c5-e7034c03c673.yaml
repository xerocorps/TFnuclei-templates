  description: "The Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, Registration, Login, Member\
    \ Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to blind SQL Injection via the search parameter in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.10.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack\
    \ of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already\
    \ existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the\
    \ database. This vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.9.2 when initially\
    \ addressing CVE-2025-0308.\n"
