  description: 'The Home Villas | Real Estate WordPress Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in the ''wp_rem_cs_widget_file_delete'' function in all versions up to, and including,
    2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead
    to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
