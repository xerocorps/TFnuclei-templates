  description: 'The Reveal Listing plugin by smartdatasoft for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due to
    the plugin allowing users who are registering new accounts to set their own role
    or by supplying ''listing_user_role'' field. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the administrator
    role.
