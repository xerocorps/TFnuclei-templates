  description: 'The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on
    the file_batch_delete_callback() function used to delete uploaded attachments
    in versions up to, and including, 4.7.7. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to delete arbitrary
    media files on a WordPress site.
