  description: 'The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar &#8211; Amelia plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and
    including, 1.2.19 via the ''wpAmeliaApiCall'' function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application,
    which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful
    on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an
    affected website.
