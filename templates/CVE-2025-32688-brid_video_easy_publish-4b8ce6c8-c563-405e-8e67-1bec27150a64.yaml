  description: 'The The Target Video Easy Publish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.5.
    This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not
    properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute
    arbitrary shortcodes.
