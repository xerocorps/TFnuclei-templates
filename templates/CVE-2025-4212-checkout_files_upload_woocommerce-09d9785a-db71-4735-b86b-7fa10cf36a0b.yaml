  description: 'The Checkout Files Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up
    to, and including, 2.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in image files that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
