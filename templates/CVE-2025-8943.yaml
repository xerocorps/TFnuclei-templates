  description: 'The Custom MCPs feature is designed to execute OS commands, for instance,
    using tools like `npx` to spin up local MCP Servers. However, Flowise''s inherent
    authentication and authorization model is minimal and lacks role-based access
    controls (RBAC). Furthermore, in Flowise versions before 3.0.1 the default installation
    operates without authentication unless explicitly configured. This combination
    allows unauthenticated network attackers to execute unsandboxed OS commands.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands
    on the target server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data
    theft, and lateral movement within the network.
