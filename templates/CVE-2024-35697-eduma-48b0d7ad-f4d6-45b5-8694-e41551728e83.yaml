  description: 'The Eduma plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.7 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
