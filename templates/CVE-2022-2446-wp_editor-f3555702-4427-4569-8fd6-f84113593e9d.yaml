  description: 'The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization
    of untrusted input via the ''current_theme_root'' parameter in versions up to,
    and including 1.2.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative
    privileges to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary
    PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted
    a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful
    in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
