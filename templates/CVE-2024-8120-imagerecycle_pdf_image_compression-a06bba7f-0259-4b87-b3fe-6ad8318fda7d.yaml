  description: 'The ImageRecycle pdf & image compression plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.14. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the class/class-image-otimizer.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings
    along with performing other actions via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
