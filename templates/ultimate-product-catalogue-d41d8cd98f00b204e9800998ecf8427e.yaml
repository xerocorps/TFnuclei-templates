  description: The Ultimate Product Catalog plugin for WordPress has multiple vulnerabilities
    in versions up to, and including, 3.1.2. This is due to a lack of sanitization
    of user input and insufficient checks on file types. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link, and for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
