  description: 'The Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.6 via deserialization of untrusted input
    in the ''recursive_unserialized_replace'' function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
    in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin
    or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete
    arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
