  description: 'The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and excluding,
    6.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user''s
    email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user''s
    password and gain access to their account.
