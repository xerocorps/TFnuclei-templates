  description: "The a3 Lazy Load, a3 Portfolio, Contact Us Page \u2013 Contact People,\
    \ Dynamic Product Gallery for WooCommerce, a3 Responsive Slider, and Compare Products\
    \ for WooCommerce plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery\
    \ respectively in versions up to, and including, 2.5.0, 3.0.0, 3.6.0, 2.9.0, 2.0.12,\
    \ 2.8.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the save_settings function\
    \ present in all three plugins. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to to update the plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick\
    \ a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. \
    \ \n        \n        It is also worth noting that there were several additional\
    \ changes in the plugins related to sanitization and escaping so there may be\
    \ other vulnerabilities that were fixed as part of these releases.\n"
