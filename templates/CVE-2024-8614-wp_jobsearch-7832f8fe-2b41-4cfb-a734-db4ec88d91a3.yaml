  description: 'The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the jobsearch_wp_handle_upload()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
