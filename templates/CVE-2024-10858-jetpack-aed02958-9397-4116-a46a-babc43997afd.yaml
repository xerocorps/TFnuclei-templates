  description: "The Jetpack \u2013 WP Security, Backup, Speed, & Growth plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via 'postmessage'\
    \ in versions 13.0 to 14.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link. The issue only affects websites hosted\
    \ on WordPress.com.\n"
