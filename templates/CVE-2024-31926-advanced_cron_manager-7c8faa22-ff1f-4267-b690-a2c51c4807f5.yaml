  description: "The Advanced Cron Manager \u2013 debug & control plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 2.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
