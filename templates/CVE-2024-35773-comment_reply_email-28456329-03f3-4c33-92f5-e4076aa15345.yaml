  description: 'The Comment Reply Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the optionsPage() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings and inject malicious
    web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
