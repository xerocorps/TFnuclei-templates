  description: 'The Products, Order & Customers Export for WooCommerce plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg
    & remove_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up
    to, and including, 2.0.15. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
