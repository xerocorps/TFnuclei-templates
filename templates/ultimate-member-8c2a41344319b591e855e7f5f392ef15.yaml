  description: "The Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, User Registration, Login\
    \ & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion\
    \ and reading when the file upload functionality is enabled for the user profile\
    \ and registration forms in versions up to, and including 2.0.45. This is due\
    \ to the fact that the plugin did not perform sufficient file path validation\
    \ or restrict the files that users had access to when performing a file download\
    \ or deletion. This makes it possible for low-level privileged attackers to delete\
    \ arbitrary files such as the wp-config.php file and ultimately achieve remote\
    \ code execution.\n"
