  description: 'The SVG Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the SVG upload feature in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.7
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, even when the ''Sanitize
    SVG while uploading'' feature is enabled. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note that
    successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the administrator to allow
    author-level users to upload SVG files. As of 2.5.6, SVG sanitization can still
    be bypassed by supplying a content-type other than image/svg+xml.
