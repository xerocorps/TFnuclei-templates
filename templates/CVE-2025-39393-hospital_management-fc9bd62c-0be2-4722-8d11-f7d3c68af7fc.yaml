  description: 'The Hospital Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in version * -47.0(20-11-2023)
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
