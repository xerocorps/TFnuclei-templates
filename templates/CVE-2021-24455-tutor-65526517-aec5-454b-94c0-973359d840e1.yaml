  description: "The Tutor LMS \u2013 eLearning and online course solution WordPress\
    \ plugin before 1.9.2 did not escape the Summary field of Announcements (when\
    \ outputting it in an attribute), which can be created by users as low as Tutor\
    \ Instructor. This lead to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue, which is triggered\
    \ when viewing the Announcements list, and could result in privilege escalation\
    \ when viewed by an admin.\n"
