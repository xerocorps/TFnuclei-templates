  description: "The Greenshift \u2013 animation and page builder blocks plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Server-Side Request Forgery\
    \ and Stored Cross Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.0\
    \ due to a missing capability check in the greenshift_download_file_localy function,\
    \ along with no SSRF protection and sanitization on uploaded SVG files. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,\
    \ to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application\
    \ that can also be leveraged to download malicious SVG files containing Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting payloads to the server. On Cloud-based servers, attackers could retrieve\
    \ the instance metadata. The issue was partially patched in version 8.9.9 and\
    \ fully patched in version 9.0.1.\n"
