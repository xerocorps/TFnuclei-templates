  description: "The affiliate-toolkit \u2013 WordPress Affiliate Plugin is vulnerable\
    \ to Open Redirect in versions up to, and including, 3.3.9. This is due to insufficient\
    \ validation on the redirect url supplied via the 'url' parameter in atkpout.php.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially\
    \ malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.\
    \ Only sites that do not have a atkp-imagereceiver-key.php setup are vulnerable,\
    \ as the attacker must calculate the md5 hash of the URL combined with the key\
    \ from that file in order to successfully redirect victims. If atkp-imagereceiver-key.php\
    \ is not present, the md5 hash of atkpout.php, which is publicly available, will\
    \ be used, allowing redirection.\n"
