  description: The Ya'aburnee and Dignitas themes for WordPress are vulnerable to
    Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 and 1.1.9 via the
    'df_save_options' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to escalate their privileges on the vulnerable service and gain otherwise restricted
    access to Admin actions.
