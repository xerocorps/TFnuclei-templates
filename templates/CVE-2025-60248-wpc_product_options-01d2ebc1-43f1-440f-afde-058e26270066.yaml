  description: 'The WPC Product Options for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
    to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of
    any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
    sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe"
    file types can be uploaded and included.
