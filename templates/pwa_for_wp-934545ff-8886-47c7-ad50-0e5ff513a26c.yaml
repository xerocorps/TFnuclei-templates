  description: 'The PWA for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages.
