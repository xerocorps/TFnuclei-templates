  description: 'The Storely theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via a malicious display name in all versions up to, and including, 18
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
