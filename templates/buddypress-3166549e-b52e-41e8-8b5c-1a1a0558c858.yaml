  description: 'The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the can_user_delete_or_update( ) function
    from versions starting at 7.0.0 to 7.2.1. This makes it possible for recently
    demoted user to modify groups in which they were the original creator.
