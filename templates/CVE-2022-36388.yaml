  description: 'The YDS Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to create user tickets, and perform other actions,
    via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.

    It should be noted that several actions are also available to unauthenticated
    users via nopriv ajax actions.'
