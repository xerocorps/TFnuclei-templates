  description: 'The Light Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete poll answers via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
