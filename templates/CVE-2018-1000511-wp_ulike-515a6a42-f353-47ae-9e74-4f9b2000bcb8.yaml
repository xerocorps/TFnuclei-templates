    cvss-score: 7.5
  description: 'The WP ULike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
    due to a missing capability check on the wp_ulike_logs_process function in versions
    before 3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with low-level
    privileges to delete any row of certain tables. This can also be exploited via
    Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a lack of nonce validation.
