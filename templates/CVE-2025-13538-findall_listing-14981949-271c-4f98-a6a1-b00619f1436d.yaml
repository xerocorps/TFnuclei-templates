  description: 'The FindAll Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the ''findall_listing_user_registration_additional_params''
    function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the ''administrator'' role
    during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability
    can only be exploited if the FindAll Membership plugin is also activated, because
    user registration is in that plugin.
