  description: 'The Responsive FlipBook Plugin Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the rfbwp_save_settings() functionin all versions
    up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
