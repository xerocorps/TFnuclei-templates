  description: 'The InPost Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''admin_thumb_width'' parameter in versions up to, and including,
    2.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
