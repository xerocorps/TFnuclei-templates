  description: 'The "RH - Real Estate WordPress Theme" theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.0. This is due
    to the theme not properly restricting user roles that can be updated as part of
    the inspiry_update_profile() function. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to set their role to that of
    an administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.4.0, and
    fully patched in version 4.4.1.
