  description: "The BookingPress \u2013 Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Online\
    \ Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification\
    \ of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check\
    \ on the bookingpress_import_data_continue_process_func function in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress\
    \ site and upload arbitrary files. This can be leveraged to update the default\
    \ role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers\
    \ to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.\n"
