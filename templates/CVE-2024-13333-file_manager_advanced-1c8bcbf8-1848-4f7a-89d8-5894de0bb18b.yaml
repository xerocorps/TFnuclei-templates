  description: 'The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''fma_local_file_system''
    function in versions 5.2.12 to 5.2.13. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above and upload permissions granted
    by an administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible. The function can be exploited only
    if the "Display .htaccess?" setting is enabled.
