  description: 'The Verse-O-Matic WordPress plugin through 4.1.1 does not have any
    CSRF checks in place, allowing attackers to make logged in administrators do unwanted
    actions, such as add/edit/delete arbitrary verses and change the settings. Due
    to the lack of sanitisation in the settings and verses, this could also lead to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues
