  description: 'The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.2.1. This is due to missing authorization
    validation on the activity REST-API Endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers to favorite private and hidden activity they are not authorized to access.
