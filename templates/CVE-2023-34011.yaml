  description: "The ShopConstruct \u2013 Product Catalog, Shopping Cart and eCommerce\
    \ solution for Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via multiple parameters including 'page' and 'shop_ct_path' in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
