  description: "The School Management System \u2013 SakolaWP plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_exam_setting'\
    \ and 'delete_exam_setting' actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to update exam settings via a forged request granted they can trick\
    \ a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
