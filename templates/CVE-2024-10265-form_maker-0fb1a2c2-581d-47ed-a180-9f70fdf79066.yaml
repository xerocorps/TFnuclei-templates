  description: "The Form Maker by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact\
    \ Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 1.15.30. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
