  description: 'The iThemes Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure
    backup and logfile generation in versions up to, and including, 5.3.0. This is
    due to backup and logfiles being created in a world-readable directory. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view backup and log files.
