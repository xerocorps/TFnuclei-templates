  description: 'The Cookie consent for developers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple settings fields in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.7.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
