  description: "The CoSchool LMS \u2013 A complete Learning Management System to Create\
    \ and Sell Your Courses Online plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object\
    \ Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 via deserialization of\
    \ untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject\
    \ a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which\
    \ means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing\
    \ a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional\
    \ plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to\
    \ perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute\
    \ code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
