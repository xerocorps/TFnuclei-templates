  description: 'flock is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems that
    is used to manage file locks. It can be used to synchronize access to a file among
    multiple processes, preventing conflicts and ensuring data integrity. Additionally,
    flock can be used in shell scripts to control access to critical sections of code.
