  description: 'The Create Block Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing authorization via the save_local_fonts_to_theme function
    among others in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
