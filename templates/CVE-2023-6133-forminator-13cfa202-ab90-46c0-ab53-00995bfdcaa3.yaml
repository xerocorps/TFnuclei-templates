  description: 'The Forminator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to insufficient blacklisting on the ''forminator_allowed_mime_types''
    function in versions up to, and including, 1.27.0. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server, but due to the htaccess configuration,
    remote code cannot be executed.
