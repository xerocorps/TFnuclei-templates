  description: 'The Keyy Two Factor Authentication (like Clef) plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a
    user''s identity associated with a token generated. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to generate valid
    auth tokens and leverage that to auto-login as other accounts, including administrators,
    as long as the administrator has the 2FA set up.
