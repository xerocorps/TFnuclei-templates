  description: "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.3.8.7 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'dnd_upload_cf7_upload'\n\
    \ function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object through\
    \ a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which\
    \ means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing\
    \ a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional\
    \ plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to\
    \ perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute\
    \ code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited\
    \ by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file\
    \ upload action. The Flamingo plugin must be installed and activated in order\
    \ to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability was partially patched in version\
    \ 1.3.8.8.\n"
