  description: 'The WP Statistics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 12.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on the IP parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
