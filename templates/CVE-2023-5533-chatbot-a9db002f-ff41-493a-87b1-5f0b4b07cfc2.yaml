  description: 'The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    use of AJAX actions due to missing capability checks on the corresponding functions
    in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 as well as 4.9.2. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform some of those actions that were intended
    for higher privileged users.
