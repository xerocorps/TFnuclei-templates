  description: 'The File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to remote code execution in versions up to, and including, 2.3.2.
    This is due to the plugin allowing users to upload PHP files when the shortcode
    has been added to a page/post. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users
    to potentially upload malicious PHP files if the shortcode is used on the front-end
    of the site, and makes it possible for authenticated users with access to a post
    editor to add the shortcode to a page or post and subsequently upload a malicious
    file.
