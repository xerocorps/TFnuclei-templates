  description: 'The Author: Munzir plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.9 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
