  description: 'The Otter - Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    deserialization of untrusted input via the ''fallback'' parameter in versions
    up to, and including 1.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
    with author privileges to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize
    and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious
    actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker
    is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
