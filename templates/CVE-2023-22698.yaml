  description: The Theme Blvd Responsive Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in versions up to,
    and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on the shortcode attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
    with contributor-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
