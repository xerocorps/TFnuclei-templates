  description: 'The WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    use of functionality due to a missing capability check on several functions such
    as wpsp_AddStudent(), wpsp_DeleteTeacher(), wpsp_UpdateStudent(), wpsp_DeleteStudent
    and more in versions up to, and including, 2.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with student-level access and above, modify student and teacher accounts.
