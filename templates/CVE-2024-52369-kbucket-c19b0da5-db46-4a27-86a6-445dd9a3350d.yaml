  description: 'The KBucket: Your Curated Content in WordPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in
    all versions up to, and including, 4.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
