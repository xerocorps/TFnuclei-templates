  description: "The Elessi theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to 6.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
