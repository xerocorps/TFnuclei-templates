  description: 'The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s button shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
    4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
    attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: The vulnerable code in this plugin is
    specifically tied to the tagDiv Newspaper theme. If another theme is installed
    (e.g., NewsMag), this code may not be present.
