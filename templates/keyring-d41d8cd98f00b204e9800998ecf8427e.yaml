  description: The Keyring plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting due to inclusion of a vulnerable OAuth SDK example file in versions
    up to, and including, 1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
