  description: 'The All In One WP Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive
    information disclosure in version 5.1.9. This is due to insufficient encryption
    on credentials stored in database logs. This makes it possible for attackers to
    retrieve the username and password of users that have logged into the site, granted
    they obtain access to the database which would require successfully exploiting
    another vulnerability such as SQL injection or use of weak passwords.
