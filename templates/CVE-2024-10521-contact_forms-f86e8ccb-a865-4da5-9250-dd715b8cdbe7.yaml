  description: 'The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete forms via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
