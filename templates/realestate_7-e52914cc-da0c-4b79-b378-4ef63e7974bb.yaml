  description: 'The Real Estate 7 Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via several parameters (ct_sqft_from, ct_sqft_to, ct_lotsize_from, ct_lotsize_to,
    & ct_mls) in versions before 3.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
