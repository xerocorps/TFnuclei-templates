    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Zox News theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
    of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check
    on the ''backup_options'' and ''restore_options'' function in all versions up
    to, and including, 3.16.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
    site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator
    and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
    to a vulnerable site.
