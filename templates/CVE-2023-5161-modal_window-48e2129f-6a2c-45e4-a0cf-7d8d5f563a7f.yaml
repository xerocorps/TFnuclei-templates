  description: 'The Modal Window plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 5.3.5 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
