  description: 'The Simple WP Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wpe_delete_file
    AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.17. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
    easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
    CVE-2025-32509 is a duplicate of this.
