  description: 'The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress allowed authenticated
    users to upload executable files to a location of their choice using the brizy_create_block_screenshot
    AJAX action. The file would be named using the id parameter, which could be prepended
    with "../" to perform directory traversal, and the file contents were populated
    via the ibsf parameter, which would be base64-decoded and written to the file.
    While the plugin added a .jpg extension to all uploaded filenames, a double extension
    attack was still possible, e.g. a file named shell.php would be saved as shell.php.jpg,
    and would be executable on a number of common configurations.
