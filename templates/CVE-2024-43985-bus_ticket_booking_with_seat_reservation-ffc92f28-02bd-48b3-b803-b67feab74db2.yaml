  description: 'The Bus Ticket Booking with Seat Reservation plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    5.3.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
