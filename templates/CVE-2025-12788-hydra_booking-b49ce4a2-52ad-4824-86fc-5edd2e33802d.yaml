  description: "The Hydra Booking \u2014 Appointment Scheduling & Booking Calendar\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing payment verification to unauthenticated\
    \ payment bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.27. This is due to\
    \ the plugin accepting client-controlled payment confirmation data in the tfhb_meeting_paypal_payment_confirmation_callback\
    \ function without server-side verification with PayPal's API. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to bypass payment requirements and confirm bookings\
    \ as paid without any actual payment transaction occurring.\n"
