  description: 'Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Limited
    File Upload in various versions. This is due to a lack of proper checks to ensure
    lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
    and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js
    files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must
    be installed to exploit this vulnerability.
