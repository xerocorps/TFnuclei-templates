  description: 'A vulnerability in the TP-Link Archer C20 router with firmware version
    V6.6_230412 and earlier permits unauthorized individuals to bypass authentication
    on interfaces under the /cgi directory. When adding a Referer header with value
    "http://tplinkwifi.net" to requests, the router will recognize the request as
    passing authentication, allowing access to protected administration interfaces.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication by adding a specific
    Referer header, gaining unauthorized access to protected administration interfaces
    and router configuration.
