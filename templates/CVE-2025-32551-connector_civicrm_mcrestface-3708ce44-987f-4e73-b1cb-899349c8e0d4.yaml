  description: 'The Connector to CiviCRM with CiviMcRestFace plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    1.0.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
