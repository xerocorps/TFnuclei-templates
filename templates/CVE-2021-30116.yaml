  description: 'Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited
    in the wild in July 2021. By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a download page
    where the clients for the installation can be downloaded. The default URL for
    this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp When an attacker download a client for Windows
    and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\Program Files (x86)\Kaseya\XXXXXXXXXX\KaseyaD.ini)
    which contains an Agent_Guid and AgentPassword This Agent_Guid and AgentPassword
    can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9)
    This request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can
    be used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues discovered
    --- * Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials * Credentials of agent software
    can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie) that can be used for services not intended
    for use by agents * dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request * Access to KaseyaD.ini
    gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the Kaseya installation
    and its clients. Impact --- Via the page /dl.asp enough information can be obtained
    to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated)
    attacks against the system.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can obtain Agent_Guid and AgentPassword credentials
    via the download page, gaining authenticated access to execute further attacks
    against Kaseya VSA.
