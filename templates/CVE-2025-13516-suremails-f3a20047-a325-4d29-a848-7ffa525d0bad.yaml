  description: "The SureMail \u2013 SMTP and Email Logs Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in versions up to and including\
    \ 1.9.0. This is due to the plugin's save_file() function in inc/emails/handler/uploads.php\
    \ which duplicates all email attachments to a web-accessible directory (wp-content/uploads/suremails/attachments/)\
    \ without validating file extensions or content types. Files are saved with predictable\
    \ names derived from MD5 hashes of their content. While the plugin attempts to\
    \ protect this directory with an Apache .htaccess file to disable PHP execution,\
    \ this protection is ineffective on nginx, IIS, and Lighttpd servers, or on misconfigured\
    \ Apache installations. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ achieve Remote Code Execution by uploading malicious PHP files through any public\
    \ form that emails attachments, calculating the predictable filename, and directly\
    \ accessing the file to execute arbitrary code granted they are exploiting a site\
    \ running on an affected web server configuration.\n"
