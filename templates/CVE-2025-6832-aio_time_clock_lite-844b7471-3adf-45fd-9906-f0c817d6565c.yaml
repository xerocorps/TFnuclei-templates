  description: "The All in One Time Clock Lite \u2013 Tracking Employee Time Has Never\
    \ Been Easier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the 'nonce' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
