  description: 'The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation in all versions 2.2.87 to 2.2.90. This is due to the plugin
    not properly restricting what user meta values can be updated and ensuring a form
    is active. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    access and above, to update their user meta to become an administrator.
