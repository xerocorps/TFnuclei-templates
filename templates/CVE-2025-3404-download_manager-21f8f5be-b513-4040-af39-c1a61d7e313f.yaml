  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the savePackage function
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.12. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the
    server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is
    deleted (such as wp-config.php).
