  description: 'The WP Carticon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''carticon_js_script'' parameter in all versions up to, and
    including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
