  description: "The `Kudos Donations \u2013 Easy donations and payments with Mollie`\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to\
    \ the use of `add_query_arg` without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 3.2.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute if they can successfully trick\
    \ a user into performing an action, such as clicking on a specially crafted link.\n"
