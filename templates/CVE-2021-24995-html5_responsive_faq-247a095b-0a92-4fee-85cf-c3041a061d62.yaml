  description: 'The HTML5 Responsive FAQ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.8.5 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for high privilege
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.  This exploit can occur even when unfiltered_html
    is disallowed.
