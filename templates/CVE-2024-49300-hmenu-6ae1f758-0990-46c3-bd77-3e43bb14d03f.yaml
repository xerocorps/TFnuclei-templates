  description: 'The Hero Mega Menu - Responsive WordPress Menu Plugin plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including,
    1.16.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
