  description: "The myCred \u2013 Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks,\
    \ Badges, and Loyalty Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 2.9.7. This is due to the plugin not properly\
    \ verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to approve withdrawal requests, modify user point\
    \ balances, and manipulate the payment processing system via the cashcred_pay_now\
    \ AJAX action.\n"
