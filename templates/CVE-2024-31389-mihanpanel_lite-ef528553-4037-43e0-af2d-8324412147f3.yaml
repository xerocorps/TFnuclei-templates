  description: 'The MihanPanel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to 12.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on the delete and delete_all cases. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete IP addresses from the blocked list via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
