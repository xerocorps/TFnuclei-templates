  description: 'The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass in versions up to, and including 1.2.8 due to missing capability checks
    on the init() function found in the ~/admin/class-photoblocks-admin.php file.
    This makes it possible for authenticated users with minimal permissions, such
    as a subscriber, to delete and clone gallery photoblocks.
