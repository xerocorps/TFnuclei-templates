  description: 'The CM Answers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 3.1.9 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with administrator-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
