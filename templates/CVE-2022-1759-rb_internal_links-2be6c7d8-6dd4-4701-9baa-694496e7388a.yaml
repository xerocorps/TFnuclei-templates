  description: 'The RB Internal Links WordPress plugin through 2.0.16 does not have
    CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to
    make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack, as well as perform Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting attacks due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping
