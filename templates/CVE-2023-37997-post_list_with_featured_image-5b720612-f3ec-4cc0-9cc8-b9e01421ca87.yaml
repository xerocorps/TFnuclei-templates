  description: 'The Post List With Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page.
