  description: 'The Euclid Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on the upload-handler function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
