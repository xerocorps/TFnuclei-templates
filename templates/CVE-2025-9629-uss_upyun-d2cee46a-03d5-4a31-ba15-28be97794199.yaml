    cvss-score: 4.3
  description: 'The USS Upyun plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the uss_setting_page function when processing the
    uss_set form type. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify
    critical Upyun cloud storage settings including bucket name, operator credentials,
    upload paths, and image processing parameters via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
