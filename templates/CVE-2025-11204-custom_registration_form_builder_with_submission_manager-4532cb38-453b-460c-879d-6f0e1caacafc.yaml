  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration,\
    \ Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.6.2 due to insufficient escaping on\
    \ the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing\
    \ SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator\
    \ access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries\
    \ that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. An unauthenticated\
    \ attacker could utilize an injected Cross-Site Scripting via user-agent on form\
    \ submission to leverage this to achieve Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.\n"
