  description: The Travel Booking WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to both
    Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up
    to, and including, 2.7.8.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link, and for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.
