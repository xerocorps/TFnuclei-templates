  description: "The Maspik \u2013 Ultimate Spam Protection plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.5.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clear_log\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear all\
    \ spam logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
