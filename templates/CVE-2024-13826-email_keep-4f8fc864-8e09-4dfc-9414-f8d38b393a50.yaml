  description: 'The Email Keep plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete emails granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
