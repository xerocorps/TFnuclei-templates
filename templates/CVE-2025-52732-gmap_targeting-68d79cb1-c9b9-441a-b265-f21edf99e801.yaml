  description: "The Google Map Targeting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local\
    \ File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
