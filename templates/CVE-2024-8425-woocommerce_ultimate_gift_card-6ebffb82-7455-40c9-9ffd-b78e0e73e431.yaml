    cvss-score: 9.8
  description: 'The WooCommerce Ultimate Gift Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the ''mwb_wgm_preview_mail''
    and ''mwb_wgm_woocommerce_add_cart_item_data'' functions in all versions up to,
    and including, 2.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code
    execution possible. Please note that this may have been patched on an older version
    than 2.9.2, however, we do not have access to older versions of the software to
    confirm when the patch was added. The only patched version we have confirmed is
    2.9.3.
