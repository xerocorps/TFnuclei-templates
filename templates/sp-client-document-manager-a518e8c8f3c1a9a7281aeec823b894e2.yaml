  description: The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.56. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in several functions. Furthermore,
    in several instances user input is not properly sanitized or escaped. This makes
    it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
