  description: 'The Eyewear prescription form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.1. This is due
    to missing authorization checks on the SubmitCatProductRequest AJAX action. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary WooCommerce
    products with custom names, prices, and category assignments via the ''Name'',
    ''Price'', and ''Parent'' parameters.
