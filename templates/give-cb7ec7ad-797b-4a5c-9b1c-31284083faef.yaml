  description: 'The GiveWP plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
    up to, and including, 2.25.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on the ''save'' AJAX function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to import donations via forged request granted a CSV file containing those donations
    has been uploaded and they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
