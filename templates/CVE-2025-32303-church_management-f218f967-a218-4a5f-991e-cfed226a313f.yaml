  description: 'The WPCHURCH plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in
    versions up to, and including, 2.7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user
    supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database.
