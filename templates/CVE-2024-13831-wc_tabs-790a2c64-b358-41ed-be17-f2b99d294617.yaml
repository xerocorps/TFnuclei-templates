    cvss-score: 7.2
  description: 'The Tabs for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
    Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via deserialization
    of untrusted input in the ''product_has_custom_tabs'' function. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above,
    to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software,
    which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing
    a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
    actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code
    depending on the POP chain present.
