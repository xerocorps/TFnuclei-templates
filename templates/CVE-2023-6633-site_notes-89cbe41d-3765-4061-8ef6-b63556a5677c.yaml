  description: 'The Site Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete admin notes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
