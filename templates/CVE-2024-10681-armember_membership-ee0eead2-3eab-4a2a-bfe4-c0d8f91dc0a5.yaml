  description: "The The ARMember \u2013 Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member\
    \ Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary\
    \ shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.51. This is due\
    \ to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate\
    \ a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.\n"
