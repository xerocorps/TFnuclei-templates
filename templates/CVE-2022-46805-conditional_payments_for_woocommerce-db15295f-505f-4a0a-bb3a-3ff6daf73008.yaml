  description: 'The Conditional Payments for WooCommerce plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''toggle_ruleset'' function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable arbitrary rulesets
    via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
