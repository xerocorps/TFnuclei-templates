  description: 'The SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style
    and embed multiple forms of any complexity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to a missing capability check on the callback function
    of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.17.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
    and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This function
    is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery as of 1.12.20.
