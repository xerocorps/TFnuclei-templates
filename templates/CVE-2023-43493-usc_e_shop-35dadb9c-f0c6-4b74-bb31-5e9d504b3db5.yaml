  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    via multiple parameters in the ''get_logs'' functionality in versions up to, and
    including, 2.8.21 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameters
    and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers with user level 5 or higher (which corresponds roughly
    to Author-level capabilities) to append additional SQL queries into already existing
    queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
