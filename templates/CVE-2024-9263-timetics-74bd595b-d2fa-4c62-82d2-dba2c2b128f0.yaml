  description: 'The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online
    Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Account Takeover/Privilege
    Escalation via Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.25 via the save() due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the emails and passwords
    of arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, which makes account takeover
    and privilege escalation possible.
