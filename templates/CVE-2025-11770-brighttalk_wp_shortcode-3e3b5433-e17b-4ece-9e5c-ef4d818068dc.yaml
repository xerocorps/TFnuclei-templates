  description: 'The BrightTALK WordPress Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''format'' shortcode attribute in the brighttalk-time
    shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
