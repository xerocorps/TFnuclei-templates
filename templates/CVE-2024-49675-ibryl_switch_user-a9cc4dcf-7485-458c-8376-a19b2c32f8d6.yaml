  description: 'The iBryl Switch User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin
    not properly verifying if a user has the appropriate permissions to switch as
    another user. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    access and above, to access other users accounts and elevate their privileges
    when that account has administrative, or other, level access.
