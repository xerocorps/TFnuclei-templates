    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The Easy Google Analytics for WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in the ''ga_admin_set.php'' file. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s Google Analytics
    account and client ID options to arbitrary values including a stored Cross-Site
    Scripting payload granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link. Additionally the ''ga_admin_set.php'' can
    be accessed directly, and though it is not possible to update options by doing
    so, loading it via a separate LFI vulnerability would allow an attacker to update
    options as well.
