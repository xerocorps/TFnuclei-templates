  description: The Role Based Pricing for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation, and insufficient
    authorization in versions up to, and including, 1.6.1. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
