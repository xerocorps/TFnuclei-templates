  description: 'The Crafthemes Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''process_uploaded_files''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
