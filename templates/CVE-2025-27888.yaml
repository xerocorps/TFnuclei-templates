  description: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Improper Neutralization of Input\
    \ During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),\_URL Redirection to Untrusted\
    \ Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in Apache Druid.This issue affects all\
    \ previous Druid versions.When using the Druid management proxy, a request that\
    \ has a specially crafted URL could be used to redirect the request to an arbitrary\
    \ server instead. This has the potential for XSS or XSRF. The user is required\
    \ to be authenticated for this exploit. The management proxy is enabled in Druid's\
    \ out-of-box configuration. It may be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability.\
    \ If the management proxy is disabled, some web console features will not work\
    \ properly, but core functionality is unaffected.Users are recommended to upgrade\
    \ to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1, which fixes the issue.\n"
  impact: 'Authenticated attackers can exploit SSRF vulnerabilities through the management
    proxy to redirect requests to arbitrary servers, potentially enabling XSS, XSRF
    attacks, or accessing internal services.
