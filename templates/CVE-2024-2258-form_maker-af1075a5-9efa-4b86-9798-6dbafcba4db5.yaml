  description: "The Form Maker by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact\
    \ Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via a user's display name autofilled into forms in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.15.24 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page.\n"
