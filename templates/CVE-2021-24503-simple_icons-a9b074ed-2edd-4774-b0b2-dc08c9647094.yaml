  description: "The Popular Brand Icons \u2013 Simple Icons WordPress plugin before\
    \ 2.7.8 does not sanitise or validate some of its shortcode parameters, such as\
    \ \"color\", \"size\" or \"class\", allowing users with a role as low as Contributor\
    \ to set Cross-Site payload in them. A post made by a contributor would still\
    \ have to be approved by an admin to have the XSS triggered in the frontend, however,\
    \ higher privilege users, such as editor could exploit this without the need of\
    \ approval, and even when the blog disallows the unfiltered_html capability.\n"
