  description: 'The Advanced Custom Fields & Secure Custom Fields plugins for WordPress
    are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via ACF field labels in all versions
    up to, and including, 6.3.8 & 6.3.6.2 respectively due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
    installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. Please
    follow the reference listed in this vulnerability record for instructions on how
    to update to the latest version of ACF that patches this issue and ensures accessibility
    to updates moving forward. Special note: only the minified files in Secure Custom
    Fields have been patched meaning the source build files are still vulnerable.
