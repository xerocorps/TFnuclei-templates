  description: 'The Easy Cookies Policy WordPress plugin through 1.6.2 is lacking
    any capability and CSRF check when saving its settings, allowing any authenticated
    users (such as subscriber) to change them. If users can''t register, this can
    be done through CSRF. Furthermore, the cookie banner setting is not sanitised
    or validated before being output in all pages of the frontend and the backend
    settings one, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.
