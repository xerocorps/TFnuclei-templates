  description: The WP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to a missing capability check and missing file type validation
    in the via the ~/class-wp-job-manager-ajax.php file in versions up to, and including,
    1.26.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
