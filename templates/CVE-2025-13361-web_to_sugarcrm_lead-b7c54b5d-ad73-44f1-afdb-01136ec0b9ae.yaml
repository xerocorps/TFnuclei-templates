  description: 'The Web to SugarCRM Lead plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the custom field deletion functionality. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete custom fields via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
