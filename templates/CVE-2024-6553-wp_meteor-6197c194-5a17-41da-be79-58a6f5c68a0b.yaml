  description: 'The WP Meteor Website Speed Optimization Addon plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.3.This
    is due to the plugin utilizing wpdesk and leaving test files with display_errors
    on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full
    path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information
    displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present
    for damage to an affected website.
