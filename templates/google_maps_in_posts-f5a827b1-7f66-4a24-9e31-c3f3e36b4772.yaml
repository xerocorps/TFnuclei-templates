  description: "The Google Maps in Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018icon\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
