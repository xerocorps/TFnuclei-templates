  description: 'The WordPress BasePress Migration Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
