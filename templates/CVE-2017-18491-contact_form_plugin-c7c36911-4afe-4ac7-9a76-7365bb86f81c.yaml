  description: 'The Advanced Contact Us Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    4.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the ''category''
    parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser granted they can trick the user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
