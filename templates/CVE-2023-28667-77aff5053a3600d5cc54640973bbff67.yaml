  description: 'The Lead Generated WordPress Plugin, version <= 1.23, was affected
    by an unauthenticated insecure deserialization issue. The tve_labels parameter
    of the tve_api_form_submit action is passed to the PHP unserialize() function
    without being sanitized or verified, and as a result could lead to PHP object
    injection, which when combined with certain class implementations / gadget chains
    could be leveraged to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain
    is also present.
