  description: 'The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary PHP Code Injection due to missing file type validation during the
    export in all versions up to, and including, 7.86. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to create
    an export file with the .php extension on the affected site''s server, adding
    an arbitrary PHP code to it, which may make remote code execution possible.
