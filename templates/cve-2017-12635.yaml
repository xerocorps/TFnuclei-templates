  description: Due to differences in the Erlang-based JSON parser and JavaScript-based
    JSON parser, it is possible in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1
    to submit _users documents with duplicate keys for 'roles' used for access control
    within the database, including the special case '_admin' role, that denotes administrative
    users. In combination with CVE-2017-12636 (Remote Code Execution), this can be
    used to give non-admin users access to arbitrary shell commands on the server
    as the database system user. The JSON parser differences result in behaviour that
    if two 'roles' keys are available in the JSON, the second one will be used for
    authorising the document write, but the first 'roles' key is used for subsequent
    authorization for the newly created user. By design, users can not assign themselves
    roles. The vulnerability allows non-admin users to give themselves admin privileges.
