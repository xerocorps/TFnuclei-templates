  description: 'The FS Registration Password plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators, and leverage
    that to gain access to their account.
