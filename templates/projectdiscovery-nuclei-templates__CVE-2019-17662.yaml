  description: 'ThinVNC 1.0b1 is vulnerable to arbitrary file read, which leads to
    a compromise of the VNC server. The vulnerability exists even when authentication
    is turned on during the deployment of the VNC server. The password for authentication
    is stored in cleartext in a file that can be read via a ../../ThinVnc.ini directory
    traversal attack vector.

    '
  impact: 'An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the
    ThinVNC application.
