  description: 'The Wishlist Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to,
    and including, 3.25.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which
    can easily lead to remote code execution when the write file is deleted (such
    as wp-config.php).
