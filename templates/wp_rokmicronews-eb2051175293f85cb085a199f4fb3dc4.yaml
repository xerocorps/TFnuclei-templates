  description: 'The RokMicroNews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.5 due to inclusion of a vulnerable
    version of TimThumb. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser. The plugin is also vulnerable
    to Arbitrary File Upload, Denial of Service Attacks, and Full Path Disclosure.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible, deny
    availability to legitimate users, and read sensitive information such as the full
    path of the WordPress installation.
