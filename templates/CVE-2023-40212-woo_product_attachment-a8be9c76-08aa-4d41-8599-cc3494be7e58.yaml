  description: 'The WooCommerce Product Attachment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.8. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on the wcpoa_order_checkout_attachment_save()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save checkout
    page attachments on the behalf of other users via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
