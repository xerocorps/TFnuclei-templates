  description: The Event Easy Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform administrative actions via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. These actions include creating and updating customers, creating
    new services and coupons, changing settings, enabling reminders and auto approvals,
    deleting all bookings, modifying the PayPal recipient email address, and modifying
    cost of services.
