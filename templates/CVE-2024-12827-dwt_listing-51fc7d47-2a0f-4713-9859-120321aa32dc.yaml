  description: 'The DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up
    to, and including, 3.3.6. This is due to the plugin not properly checking for
    an empty token value prior to resetting a user''s password through the dwt_listing_reset_password()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary
    user''s passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access
    to their account.
