  description: 'The Modula Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ''ajax_unzip_file''
    function in versions 2.13.1 to 2.13.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the
    server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is
    deleted (such as wp-config.php).
