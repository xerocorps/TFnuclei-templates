  description: WordPress WPify Woo Czech plugin before 3.5.7 contains a cross-site
    scripting vulnerability. The plugin uses the Vies library 2.2.0, which has a sample
    file outputting $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in an attribute without being escaped first.
    The issue is only exploitable when the web server has the PDO driver installed
    and write access to the example directory.
