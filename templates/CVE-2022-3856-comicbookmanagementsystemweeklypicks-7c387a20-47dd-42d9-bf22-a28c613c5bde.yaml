  description: 'The Comic Book Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.2.0 due to insufficient escaping
    on the ''id'' parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL
    query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    privileges or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries
    that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
