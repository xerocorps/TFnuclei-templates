  description: 'The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.2.1. This is due to the plugin allowing
    arbitrary data to be passed to wp_insert_user() during registration. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update their role to that of an administrator
    during registration.
