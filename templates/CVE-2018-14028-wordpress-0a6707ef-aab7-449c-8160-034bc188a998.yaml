  description: 'In all current versions of WordPress Core before 6.4.3, plugins uploaded
    via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files
    to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but
    the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for
    an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited
    scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin
    uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and
    upload that plugin, because a machine''s wp-content/plugins directory permissions
    were set up to block all new plugins. Please note that this requires administrator
    or super administrator permissions(on multisite installations) and only impacts
    heavily locked-down installations where even these users cannot install new plugins.
    CVE-2024-31210 may be a duplicate of this issue.
