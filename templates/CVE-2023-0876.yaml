  description: The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    execution of tasks due to a missing capability check on the startProcess function
    in versions up to, and including, 4.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level access to perform tasks reserved for administrators
    such as post modifications. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin
    relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible
    to all authenticated users regardless of role. Attackers could leverage this to
    redirect victims to an arbitrary location by setting the link_redirect location
    through the update_link_redirect task.
