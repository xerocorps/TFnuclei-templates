  description: "guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in\
    \ PHP. Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could\
    \ sneak in a newline (\\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification\
    \ states that \\r\\n\\r\\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers\
    \ in the wild will also accept \\n\\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where\
    \ the fix was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5.\
    \ There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to\
    \ upgrade. \n    \n    While some WordPress plugins and themes may be using this\
    \ library, it does not make them vulnerable to exploitation.\n"
