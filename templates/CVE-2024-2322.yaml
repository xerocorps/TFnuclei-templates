  description: 'The WooCommerce Cart Abandonment Recovery plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.2.26. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete templates
    or abandoned orders via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
