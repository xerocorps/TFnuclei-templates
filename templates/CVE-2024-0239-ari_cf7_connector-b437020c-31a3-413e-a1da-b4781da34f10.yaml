  description: 'The Contact Form 7 Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute JavaScript in a victims browser
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
