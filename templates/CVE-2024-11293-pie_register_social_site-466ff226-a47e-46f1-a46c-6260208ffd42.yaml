  description: "The  Registration Forms \u2013 User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based\
    \ Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction Social\
    \ Sites Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 1.7.9. This is due to insufficient verification\
    \ on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such\
    \ as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not\
    \ have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.\n"
