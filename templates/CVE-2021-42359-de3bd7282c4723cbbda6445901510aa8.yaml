  description: "WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, \u2018admin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u2018\
    , which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated\
    \ users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests.\
    \ As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary\
    \ post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201Caction\u201D\
    \ parameter set to \u201Cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201D and the \u201Cid\u201D\
    \ parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the\
    \ post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post\
    \ in question.\n"
