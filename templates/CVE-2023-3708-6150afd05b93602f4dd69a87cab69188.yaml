  description: 'Several themes for WordPress by DeoThemes are vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via breadcrumbs in various versions due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
