  description: 'The Loginizer Security and Loginizer plugins for WordPress are vulnerable
    to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This is
    due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login
    token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing
    user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and
    the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the
    token.
