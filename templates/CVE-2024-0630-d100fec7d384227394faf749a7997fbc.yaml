  description: 'The WP RSS Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the RSS feed source in all versions up to, and including,
    4.23.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
