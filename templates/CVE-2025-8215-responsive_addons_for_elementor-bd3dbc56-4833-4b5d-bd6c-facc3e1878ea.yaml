  description: 'The Responsive Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple widgets in all versions up to, and
    including, 2.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
    user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
