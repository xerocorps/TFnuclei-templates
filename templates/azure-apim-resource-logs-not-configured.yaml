  description: 'Ensure that your Azure API Management API services are configured
    to use resource logs to collect valuable information on API Management operations
    and errors. By enabling resource logs through a diagnostic setting, you can gather
    extensive information on the API requests received and handled by the Azure API
    Management service gateway.

    '
  impact: 'Failing to configure resource logs for Azure API Management services could
    result in a lack of visibility into API performance and errors, hindering effective
    management and troubleshooting.

  remediation: 'Ensure that resource logs are enabled by setting up diagnostic settings
    for each Azure API Management service instance. This should include capturing
    all logs related to API operations and errors.
