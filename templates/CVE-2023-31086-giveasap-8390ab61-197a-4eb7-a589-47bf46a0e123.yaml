  description: 'The Simple Giveaways plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.46. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to save plugin settings, end giveaways and select winners
    among other things as subscribers via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
