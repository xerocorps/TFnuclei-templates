  description: "The App Builder \u2013 Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Flight\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.7. This is due to the verify_otp_forgot_password()\
    \ and update_password() functions not having enough controls to prevent a successful\
    \ brute force attack of the OTP to change a password, or verify that a password\
    \ reset request came from an authorized user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to generate and brute force an OTP that makes it possible to change\
    \ any users passwords, including an administrator.\n"
