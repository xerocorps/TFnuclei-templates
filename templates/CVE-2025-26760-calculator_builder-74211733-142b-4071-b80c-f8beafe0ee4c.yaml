  description: "The Calculator Builder \u2013 Create an Online Calculator plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.6.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute\
    \ arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those\
    \ files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or\
    \ achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file\
    \ types can be uploaded and included.\n"
