  description: 'IcedID, also known as BokBot, is a modular banking trojan that targets
    user financial information and is capable of acting as a dropper for other malware.
    It uses a man-in-the-browser attack to steal financial information, including
    login credentials for online banking sessions. Once it successfully completes
    its initial attack, it uses the stolen information to take over banking accounts
    and automate fraudulent transactions. IcedID is primarily dropped as a secondary
    payload from other malware, most notably Emotet, in addition to its own malspam
    campaigns. IcedID uses multiple injection methods to evade antivirus and other
    malware detection methods, such as injecting itself into operating system (OS)
    memory and regular processes. The malware authors are known to update IcedID to
    increase persistence and evade new detection efforts.
