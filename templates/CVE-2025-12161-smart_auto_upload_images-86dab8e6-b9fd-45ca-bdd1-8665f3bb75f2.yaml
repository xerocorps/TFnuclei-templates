  description: 'The Smart Auto Upload Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the auto-image creation
    functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
