  description: 'The WP Fundraising Donation and Crowdfunding Platform plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    1.7.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wfp_donate_settings()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin
    settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
