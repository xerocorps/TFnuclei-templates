  description: 'The Hospital Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in
    all versions up to, and including, 47.0(20-11-2023). This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
