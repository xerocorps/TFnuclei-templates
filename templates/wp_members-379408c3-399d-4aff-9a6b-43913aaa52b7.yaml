  description: 'The WP Members plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple Cross-Site
    Scripting via several parameters in versions before 2.8.10 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to
    inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
