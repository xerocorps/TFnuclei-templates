  description: 'The Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to denial of service
    in versions up to, and including, 3.6.25. This is due to insufficient controls
    on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to craft
    form submissions with excessive extra data that may exceed the capacity of the
    database and prevent further requests from being successful while the submission
    is processing.
