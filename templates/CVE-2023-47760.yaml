  description: 'The Essential Blocks for Gutenberg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized access to AJAX actions due to a missing capability check on several
    functions in versions up to, and including, 4.2.0. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to invoke those
    functions. A nonce check was performed in all of them. However, the nonce was
    leaked on the profile page.
