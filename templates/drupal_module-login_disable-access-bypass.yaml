  description: This module enables you to prevent existing users from logging in to
    your Drupal site unless they know the secret key to add to the end of the ?q=user
    login form page. The Login Disable module does not correctly prevent a user with
    a disabled login from logging in, allowing those users to by-pass the protection
    offered by the module. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker
    must already have a user account to log in. This bug therefore allows users to
    log in even if their login is disabled.
