  description: The Event Management, Events Calendar, RSVP Event Tickets Plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters
    in versions up to, and including, 3.8.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
