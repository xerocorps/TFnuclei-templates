  description: 'The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the buddypress/v1/groups/invites REST-API
    endpoint in versions up to, and including, 7.2.0. This makes it possible for a
    member to invite another member to join a group without being friends when that
    group restricted invites to friends only.
