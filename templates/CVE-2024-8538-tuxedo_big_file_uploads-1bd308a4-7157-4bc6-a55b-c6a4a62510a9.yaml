  description: "The Big File Uploads \u2013 Increase Maximum File Upload Size plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 2.1.2. This is due the plugin not sanitizing a file path in an error\
    \ message. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level\
    \ access and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can\
    \ be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its\
    \ own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected\
    \ website.\n"
