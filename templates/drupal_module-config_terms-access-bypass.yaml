info:
  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module enables you to create and manage a version of taxonomy
    based on configuration entities instead of content.  This allows the terms, vocabularies,
    and their structure to be exported, imported, and managed as site configuration.
    The module doesnt sufficiently check access for the edit and delete operations.
    Users with access content permission can edit or delete any term. The edit form
    may expose term data that users could not otherwise see, since there is no term
    view route by default. This vulnerability is slightly mitigated by the fact that
    an attacker must have a role with the permission access content, so may not be
    accessible to anonymous users on all sites.
