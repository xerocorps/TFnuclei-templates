  description: "The Direct Checkout for WooCommerce \u2013 Skip Cart with Buy Buttons\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the save()\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the\
    \ plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
