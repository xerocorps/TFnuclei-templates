  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2015-10115
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The WooSidebars Sidebar Manager Converter plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via a URL parameter in versions up
    to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    and the use of add_query_arg. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note
    that the CVE has this recorded as an Open Redirect, however, this patch is related
    to Cross-Site Scripting.
