  description: 'The Team Builder For WPBakery Page Builder(Formerly Visual Composer)
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s
    ''team-builder-vc'' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
