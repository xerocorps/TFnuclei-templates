  description: 'The Save as PDF Plugin by Pdfcrowd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
