  description: 'The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the ajax() function, or BMI_Ajax class. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to control any of the plugin''s settings, and restore/delete/modify
    back-ups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
