  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory
    Listing in versions up to, and including, 2.8.7. This is due to the ''wpdm_dir_tree()''
    function being called during the ''init'' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to read all of the files listed in that directory.
