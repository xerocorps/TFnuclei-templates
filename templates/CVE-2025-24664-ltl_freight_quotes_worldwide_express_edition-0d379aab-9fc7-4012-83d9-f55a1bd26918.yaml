  description: "The LTL Freight Quotes \u2013 Worldwide Express Edition plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 5.0.20\
    \ due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient\
    \ preparation on the existing SQL query in the /shipping-rules/shipping-rules-save.php\
    \ file.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional\
    \ SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive\
    \ information from the database.\n"
