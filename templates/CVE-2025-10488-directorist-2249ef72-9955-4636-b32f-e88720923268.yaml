  description: 'The Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified
    Ads Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file move due to
    insufficient file path validation in the add_listing_action AJAX action in all
    versions up to, and including, 8.4.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).
