  description: 'The WP Post Statistics (Visitors & Visits Counter) plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via spoofed IP addresses in versions
    up to, and including, 2.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
