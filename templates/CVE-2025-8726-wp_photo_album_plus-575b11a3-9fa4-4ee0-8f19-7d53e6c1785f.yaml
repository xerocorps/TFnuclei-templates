  description: 'The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.11.006 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping in the wppa_user_upload function. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in the photo album descriptions that execute
    in a victim''s browser.
