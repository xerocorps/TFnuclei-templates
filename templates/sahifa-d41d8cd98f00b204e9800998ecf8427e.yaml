  description: The Sahifa theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation in the 'mpanel-functions.php' file. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative
    actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
