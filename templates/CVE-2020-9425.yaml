  description: An issue was discovered in includes/head.inc.php in rConfig before
    3.9.4. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve saved cleartext credentials via
    a GET request to settings.php. Because the application does not exit after a redirect
    is applied, the rest of the page still executed, resulting in the disclosure of
    cleartext credentials in the response.
