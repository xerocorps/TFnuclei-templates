  description: 'The Smart Post Show plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Pagination Color setting in all versions up to, and including,
    3.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
