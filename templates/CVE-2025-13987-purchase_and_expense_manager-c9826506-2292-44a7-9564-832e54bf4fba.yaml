  description: 'The Purchase and Expense Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This
    is due to missing nonce validation on the ''sup_pt_handle_deletion'' function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary purchase
    records via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
