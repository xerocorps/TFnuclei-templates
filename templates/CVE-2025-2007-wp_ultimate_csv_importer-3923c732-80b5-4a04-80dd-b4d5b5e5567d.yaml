  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2025-2007
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The Import Export Suite for CSV and XML Datafeed plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in the deleteImage() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.19. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). Please
    note this vulnerability was reintroduced in 7.20, and subsequently patched again
    in 7.20.1.
