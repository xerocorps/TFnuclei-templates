  description: 'The Keap Official Opt-in Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the service
    parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include PHP
    files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
    can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
    execution in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included. If register_argc_argv
    is enabled on the server and pearcmd.php is installed, this issue might lead to
    Remote Code Execution.
