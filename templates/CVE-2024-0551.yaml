  description: 'Enable exports of the database and associated exported information
    of the system via the default user role. The attacked would have to have been
    granted access to the system prior to the attack.


    It is worth noting that the deterministic nature of the export name is lower risk
    as the UI for exporting would start the download at the same time, which once
    downloaded - deletes the export from the system.


    The endpoint for exporting should simply be patched to a higher privilege level.'
