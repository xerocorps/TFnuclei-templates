  description: "The Peter\u2019s Custom Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This\
    \ is due to missing nonce validation on the cas_register_post() function. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to blacklist emails via a forged\
    \ request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action\
    \ such as clicking on a link.\n"
