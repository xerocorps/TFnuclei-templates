  description: 'The WP Full Stripe Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL
    Injection in versions up to, and including, 8.2.5 due to insufficient escaping
    on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
    SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries
    that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
