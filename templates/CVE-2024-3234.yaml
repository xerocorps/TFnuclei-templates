  description: 'The gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt application is vulnerable to a path
    traversal attack due to its use of an outdated gradio component. The application
    is designed to restrict user access to resources within the `web_assets` folder.
    However, the outdated version of gradio it employs is susceptible to path traversal,
    as identified in CVE-2023-51449. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users
    to bypass the intended restrictions and access sensitive files, such as `config.json`,
    which contains API keys. The issue affects the latest version of chuanhuchatgpt
    prior to the fixed version released on 20240305.
