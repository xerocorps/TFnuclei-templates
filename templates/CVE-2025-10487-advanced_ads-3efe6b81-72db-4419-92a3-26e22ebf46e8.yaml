  description: "The Advanced Ads \u2013\_Ad Manager & AdSense plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.12 via the select_one() function. This is due to the endpoint not properly\
    \ restricting access to the AJAX endpoint or limiting the functions that can be\
    \ called to safe functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to call arbitrary functions beginning with get_the_ like get_the_excerpt which\
    \ can make information exposure possible.\n"
