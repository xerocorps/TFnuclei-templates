  description: "The Academy LMS \u2013 WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning\
    \ Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account\
    \ takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to the plugin\
    \ not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password and\
    \ relying solely on a publicly-exposed nonce for authorization. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's password,\
    \ including administrators, and gain access to their account.\n"
