  description: 'The AnWP Football Leagues plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including,
    0.16.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    the SVG file.
