  description: 'The Satoshi theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation via the upload-file.php file in versions up
    to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
