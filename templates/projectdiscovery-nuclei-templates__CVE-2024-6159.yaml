  description: 'Push Notification for Post and BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ''onesignal_externalid'' and ''onesignal_get_subscriptionoptions_id''
    paramters in all versions up to, and including, 1.93 due to insufficient escaping
    on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
    SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
    information from the database.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can execute SQL injection attacks to extract
    sensitive database information including user credentials, subscriber data, and
    configuration details.
