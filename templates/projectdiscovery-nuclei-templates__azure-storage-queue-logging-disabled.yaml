  description: 'Ensure that Microsoft Azure Storage Queue service logging is enabled
    for read, write, and delete requests. The Storage Queue service records details
    of both successful and failed requests, including end-to-end latency, server latency,
    and authentication information, which is crucial for security and compliance.

    '
  impact: 'Not enabling logging for Azure Storage Queue can result in insufficient
    data for auditing and lack of visibility into access patterns, potentially leading
    to unauthorized access and data breaches.
