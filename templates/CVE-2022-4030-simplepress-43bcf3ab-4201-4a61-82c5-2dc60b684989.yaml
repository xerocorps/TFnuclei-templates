  description: 'The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal
    in versions up to, and including, 6.8 via the ''file'' parameter which can be
    manipulated during user avatar deletion. This makes it possible with attackers,
    with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files
    on the server that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the
    wp-config.php file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve
    remote code execution.
