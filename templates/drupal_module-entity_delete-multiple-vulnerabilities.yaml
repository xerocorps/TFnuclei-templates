info:
  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module enables you to delete any types of entities in bulk. The
    module doesnt sufficiently verify access permissions under its use cases, leading
    to access bypass. The module also does not protect against Cross Site Request
    Forgeries on its delete process. The access bypass vulnerability is mitigated
    by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission access content.
    There is no additional mitigation for the Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability.
