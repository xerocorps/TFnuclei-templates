  description: "The Contact Form Master \u2013 by Edmon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'formId' parameter in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
