  description: The OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via options such as 'oopspam_wpregister_spam_message', 'oopspam_woo_spam_message',
    and 'oopspam_give_spam_message' (as well as numerous others) in versions up to,
    and including, 1.1.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
