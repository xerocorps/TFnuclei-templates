    cvss-score: 3.7
  description: 'The AR for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    double extension file upload due to a missing capability check on the set_ar_featured_image()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 7.3. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to upload php files leveraging a double extension attack.
    It''s important to note the file is deleted immediately and double extension attacks
    only work on select servers making this unlikely to be successfully exploited.
