  classification:

    cvss-score: 5.3
  description: 'The PDF Builder for WPForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.116. This is due
    to the plugin allowing direct access to the composer-setup.php file which has
    display_errors on.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve
    the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks.
    The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability
    to be present for damage to an affected website.
