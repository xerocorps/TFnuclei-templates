  description: 'The Cf7Save Extension plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
