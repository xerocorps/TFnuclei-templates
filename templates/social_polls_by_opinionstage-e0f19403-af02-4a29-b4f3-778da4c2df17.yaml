  description: 'The Poll, Survey & Quiz Maker Plugin by Opinion Stage plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions
    up to, and including, 19.6.24 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
