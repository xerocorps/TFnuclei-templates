  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin before
    7.0.1 for WordPress. It made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution. If a quiz question could be
    answered by uploading a file, only the Content-Type header was checked during
    the upload, and thus the attacker could use text/plain for a .php file.
