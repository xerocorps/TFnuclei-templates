  description: 'The Litho theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
    due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including,
    3.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
