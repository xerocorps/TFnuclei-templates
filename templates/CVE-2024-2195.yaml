  description: 'The Aim application is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability.
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the
    "/api/runs/search/run" endpoint, which allows executing arbitrary commands on
    the target system.


    The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation and improper handling
    of user-supplied data in the "q" parameter of the "/api/runs/search/run" endpoint.
    The application fails to properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to
    inject and execute malicious code.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to complete compromise
    of the affected system, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access
    sensitive data, and potentially move laterally within the network.

  remediation: '- Update the application to a patched version that addresses this
    vulnerability.

    - Implement proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms for user-supplied
    data.

    - Follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that the application runs
    with the minimal required permissions.

    - Regularly review and update the application''s security posture.
