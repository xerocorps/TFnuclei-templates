  description: 'The Administrator Z plugin for WordPress uses Advanced Custom Fields
    which has a file upload vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 5.12.2.
    This makes it possible for users without the upload_files capability, such as
    contributors, or unauthenticated users in cases where a frontend form is added
    to the site, to upload allowed file types. The upload is handled by WordPress
    so file type and extension checks still occur, though this could potentially be
    used by high-privileged users in certain locked-down configurations to bypass
    other security mechanisms and upload dangerous file types. This affects versions
    up to, and including, 2022.9.28 in the Administrator Z plugin.
