  description: "The Barcode Scanner (+Mobile App) \u2013 Inventory manager, Order\
    \ fulfillment system, POS (Point of Sale) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.6.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the\
    \ affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
