  description: 'The Sunshine Photo Cart: Free Client Photo Galleries for Photographers
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.11. This is due to the plugin not properly
    validating a user-supplied key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user''s passwords
    through the password reset functionality, including administrators, and leverage
    that to reset the user''s password and gain access to their account.
