  description: "The Shared Files \u2013 Frontend File Upload Form & Secure File Sharing\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via dfxp File\
    \ uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.42 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses the dfxp file. This issue affects only Apache-based environments,\
    \ where dfxp files are handled by default.\n"
