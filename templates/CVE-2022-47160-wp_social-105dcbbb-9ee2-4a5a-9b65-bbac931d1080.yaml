  description: 'The Wp Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.9.0. This is due to missing capability
    checks on the ''export_users_content_csv'' function. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with minimal permissions such as subscribers to export
    user content such as user logins and passwords of various social media providers.
