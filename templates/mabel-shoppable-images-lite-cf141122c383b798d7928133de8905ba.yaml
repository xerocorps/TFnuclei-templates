  description: 'The Shoppable Images Liteplugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    disclosure and modification of data in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions used to manipulate
    images. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform image
    manipulation tasks such as deletion, which can also be leveraged to delete arbitrary
    posts.
