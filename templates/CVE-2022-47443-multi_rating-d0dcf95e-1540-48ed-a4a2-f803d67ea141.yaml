  description: 'The Multi Rating for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.0.5. This is due to missing nonce
    validation on several functions like mr_clear_database, mr_clear_cache, and mr_export_rating_results.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the cache and database
    for the plugin, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
