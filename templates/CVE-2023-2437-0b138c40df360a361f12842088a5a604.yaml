  description: 'The UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    in versions up to, and including, 5.1.1. This is due to insufficient verification
    on the user being supplied during a Facebook login through the plugin. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the
    site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email. An attacker
    can leverage CVE-2023-2448 and CVE-2023-2446 to get the user''s email address
    to successfully exploit this vulnerability.
