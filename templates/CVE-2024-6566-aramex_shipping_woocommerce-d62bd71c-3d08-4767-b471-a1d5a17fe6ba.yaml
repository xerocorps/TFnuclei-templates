  description: 'The Aramex Shipping WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.21. This is
    due the plugin not preventing direct access to the composer-setup.php file which
    also has display_errors enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other
    attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another
    vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
