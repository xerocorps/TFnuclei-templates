  description: 'The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does
    not have proper access control when updating a timeslot, allowing any user with
    the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to update arbitrary timeslot from any
    events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to
    be perform via CSRF against a logged in with such capability. In versions before
    2.3.19, the lack of sanitisation and escaping in some of the fields, like the
    descritption could also lead to Stored XSS issues
