  description: 'There is a rather strange file that directly echoes some content belonging
    to the inaccessible zzz_config.php. The information leakage file is located in
    plugins\webuploader\js\webconfig.php, and the management path name of the management
    background can be obtained directly. No need to blast admin and add 3 digits anymore
