  description: 'The Blog Manager WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
