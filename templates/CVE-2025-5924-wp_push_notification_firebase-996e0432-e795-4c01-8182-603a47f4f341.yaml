  description: 'The WP Firebase Push Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wfpn_brodcast_notification_message()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send broadcast
    notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
