  description: 'The Ultimate Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.6. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, modify, or delete user accounts,
    including accounts with administrative permissions, granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
