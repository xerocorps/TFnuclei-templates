  description: 'The Tour Master - Tour Booking, Travel, Hotel plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg
    without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including,
    5.3.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
