  description: 'The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3. This is due to the plugin
    not properly validating a users identity through the jobsearch_facebook_get_soc_login_url
    action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any
    user, including administrators, as long as they have access to the email address.
