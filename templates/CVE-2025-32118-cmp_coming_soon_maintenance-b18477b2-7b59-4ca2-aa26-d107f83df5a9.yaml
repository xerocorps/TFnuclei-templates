  description: "The CMP \u2013 Coming Soon & Maintenance Plugin by NiteoThemes plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type\
    \ validation in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.13. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload\
    \ arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution\
    \ possible.\n"
