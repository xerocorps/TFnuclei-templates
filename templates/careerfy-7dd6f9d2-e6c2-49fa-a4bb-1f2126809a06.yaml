  description: 'The Careerfy - Job Board WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''Academic Level'', ''Age'', ''Salary'',
    ''Gender'', ''Industry'', and ''Full Address'' fields in versions up to, and including,
    3.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
