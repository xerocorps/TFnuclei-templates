  description: 'The Enqueue Anything WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not have
    authorisation and CSRF checks in the remove_asset AJAX action, and does not ensure
    that the item to be deleted is actually an asset. As a result, low privilege users
    such as subscriber could delete arbitrary assets, as well as put arbitrary posts
    in the trash.
