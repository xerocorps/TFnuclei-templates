  description: 'The Sala - Startup & SaaS WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
    1.1.4. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to updating their details like password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators, and
    leverage that to gain access to their account.
