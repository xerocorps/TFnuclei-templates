  description: 'The Workreap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.5. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to (1) performing
    a social auto-login or (2) updating their profile details (e.g. password). This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to (1) login as an arbitrary user
    if their email address is known or (2) change an arbitrary user''s password, including
    administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account. NOTE: This
    vulnerability was partially fixed in version 3.2.5.
