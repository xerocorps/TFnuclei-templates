  description: 'The CoinPayments.net Payment Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.0.17
    via deserialization of untrusted input via the ''custom'' parameter. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP
    chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an
    additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
    attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
