  description: 'The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''reset_settings'' function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to reset the theme''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
