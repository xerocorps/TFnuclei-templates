  description: 'The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    in versions up to, and including, 2.15. This is due a to limited arbitrary method
    call to ''crypto_connect_ajax_process::log_in'' function in the ''crypto_connect_ajax_process''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any
    existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the
    username.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication to log in as any existing
    user including administrators if they know the username, gaining complete control
    of the WordPress site and all its data.
