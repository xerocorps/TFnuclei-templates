  description: 'The FlatPM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to 3.1.05 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
