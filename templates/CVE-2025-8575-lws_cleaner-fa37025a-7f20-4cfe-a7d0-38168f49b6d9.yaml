  description: 'The LWS Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ''lws_cl_delete_file''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.3. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete
    arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
    when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
