  description: 'The BC Menu Bar Cart Icon For WooCommerce By Binary Carpenter plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and
    including, 1.49.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an
    unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform
    an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
