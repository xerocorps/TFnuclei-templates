  description: The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check on the pgc_sgb_add_dashboard_widget
    function in versions up to, and including, 3.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level access to retrieve and edit post data and metadata,
    update and retrieve arbitrary options, retrieve post listings, as well as taxonomy
    terms and post content.
