  description: "The GiveWP \u2013 Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the donor notes\
    \ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.0 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with GiveWP worker-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Additionally,\
    \ they need to trick an administrator into visiting the legacy version of the\
    \ site.\n"
