  description: 'The Advanced Product Fields (Product Addons) for WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.6.17. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on
    the ''maybe_duplicate'' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to duplicate and publish product field groups, including draft and pending field
    groups, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
