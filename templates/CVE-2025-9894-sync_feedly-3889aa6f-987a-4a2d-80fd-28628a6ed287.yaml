    cvss-score: 4.3
  description: 'The Sync Feedly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the crsf_cron_job_func function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to trigger content synchronization from Feedly,
    potentially creating multiple posts via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
