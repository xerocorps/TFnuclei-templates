  description: 'The WPLMS  theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to 4.900. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to invoke this function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
