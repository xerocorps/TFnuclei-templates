  description: 'The ULeak Security & Monitoring WordPress plugin through 1.2.3 does
    not have authorisation and CSRF checks when updating its settings, and is also
    lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of them, which could allow any
    authenticated users such as subscriber to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting
    attacks against admins viewing the settings.
