    cvss-score: 9.8
  description: 'The Hunk Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    plugin installation/activation due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import
    REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.5. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which
    can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin
    is installed and activated. This is a bypass to CVE-2024-9707.
