  description: "The Subscribe to Unlock Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it\
    \ possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
