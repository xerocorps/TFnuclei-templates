  description: 'The Bricks Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure
    Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8 via the postId
    parameter due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify
    posts and pages created by other users including admins. As a requirement for
    this, an admin would have to enable access to the editor specifically for such
    a user or enable it for all users with a certain user account type.
