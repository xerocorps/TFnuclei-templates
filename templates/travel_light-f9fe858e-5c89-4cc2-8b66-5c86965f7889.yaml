  description: 'The Travel Light for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''booktrip'', ''filter_plcbrd_action'', ''filter_plcservice_action'',
    ''filter_action'' and ''filter_service_action'' AJAX actions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to gain restricted access to administrative actions
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
