  description: 'The Best Contact Management Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the "No Access Message" setting in versions
    up to, and including, 3.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
    and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
