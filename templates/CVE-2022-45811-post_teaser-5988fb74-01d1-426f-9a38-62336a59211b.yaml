  description: 'The Post Teaser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the init_option_page function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin''s settings, via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
