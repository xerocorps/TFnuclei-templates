  description: "The WP-BusinessDirectory \u2013 Business directory plugin for WordPress\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient\
    \ file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server,\
    \ which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted\
    \ (such as wp-config.php).\n"
