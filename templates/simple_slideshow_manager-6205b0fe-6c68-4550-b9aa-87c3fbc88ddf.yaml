  description: 'The Simple Slideshow Manager for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform several administrative actions like modifying settings via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
