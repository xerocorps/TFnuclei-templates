  description: 'The WP OER plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 0.9.0  due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
