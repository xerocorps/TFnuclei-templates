  description: 'The MD Custom content after or before of post plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject
    malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
