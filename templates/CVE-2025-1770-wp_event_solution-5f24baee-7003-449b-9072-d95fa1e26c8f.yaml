  description: "The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations \u2013\
    \ Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 4.0.24 via the 'style' parameter. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
