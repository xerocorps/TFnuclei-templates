  description: 'The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Import in all versions up to, and including,
    7.97 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
