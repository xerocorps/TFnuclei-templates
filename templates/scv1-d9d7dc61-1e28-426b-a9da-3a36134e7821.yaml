  description: 'The SCv1 Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download
    in all known versions. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user input
    on the ''file'' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to download arbitrary files, including configuration files.
