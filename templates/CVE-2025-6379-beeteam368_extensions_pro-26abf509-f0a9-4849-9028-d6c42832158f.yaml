  description: 'The BeeTeam368 Extensions Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.4 via the handle_live_fn()
    function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to perform actions on files outside of the originally intended
    directory. This vulnerability can be used to delete the wp-config.php file, which
    can be leveraged into a site takeover.
