  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via a user''s Display Name in all versions up to, and including,
    3.2.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully
    exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a
    user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.
