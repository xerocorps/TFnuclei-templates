  description: 'The Rate my Post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the has_valid_nonce function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to vote on posts, via forged request granted they
    can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
