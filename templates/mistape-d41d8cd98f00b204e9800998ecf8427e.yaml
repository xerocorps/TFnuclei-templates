  description: The Mistape plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a developer-created
    backdoor in version 1.4.0. The backdoor is present in the report_stats() function,
    when the 'cmb' parameter is set to 'user', the plugin then looks for the first
    administrative user in the database and logs the person making the request in
    as that user.  This makes it possible for an attacker to log in as an administrator
    without knowing information about users on the site. In addition, the function
    also makes Remote Code Execution possible, if the attacker has the ability to
    upload files to the server.
