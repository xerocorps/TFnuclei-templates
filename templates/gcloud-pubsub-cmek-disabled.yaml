  description: 'Ensure that your Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics are encrypted using Customer-Managed
    Encryption Keys (CMEKs) to have full control over the data encryption and decryption
    process. Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEKs) allow you to create and manage
    your own encryption keys with Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).

    '
  impact: 'Not using CMEKs for Pub/Sub topics can result in less control over data
    encryption and potential exposure to unauthorized access.
