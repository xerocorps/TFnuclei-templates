  description: 'The Media Hygiene: Remove or Delete Unused Images and More! plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability
    check on the bulk_action_delete and delete_single_image_call AJAX actions in all
    versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachments.
    A nonce check was added in version 3.0.1, however, it wasn''t until version 3.0.2
    that a capability check was added.
