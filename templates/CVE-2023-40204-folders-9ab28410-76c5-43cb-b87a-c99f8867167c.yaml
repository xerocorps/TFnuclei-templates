  description: 'The Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the handle_folders_file_upload function
    in versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with author-level permissions or above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
