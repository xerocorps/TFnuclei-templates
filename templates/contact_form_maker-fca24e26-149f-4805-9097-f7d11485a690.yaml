  description: "The Contact Form by WD \u2013 responsive drag & drop contact form\
    \ builder tool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due\
    \ to a missing capability check on the form_maker_cfm function in versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.7.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with subscriber-level permissions and above, to edit forms, including entering\
    \ stored cross-site scripting, as output is not properly escaped.\n"
