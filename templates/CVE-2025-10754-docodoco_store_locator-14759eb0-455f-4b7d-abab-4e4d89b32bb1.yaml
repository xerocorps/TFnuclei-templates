  description: 'The DocoDoco Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the zip upload functionality
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
