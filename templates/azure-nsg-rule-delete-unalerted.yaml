  description: 'Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is used to detect "Delete
    Network Security Group Rule" events in your Microsoft Azure cloud account. Activity
    log alerts get activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert occurs. In this case, the condition used is ''Whenever
    the Administrative Activity Log "Delete Security Rule (networkSecurityGroups/securityRules)"
    has "any" level with "any" status and event is initiated by "any"''.

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Delete Network Security
    Group Rule" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed, leading
    to potential security risks.
