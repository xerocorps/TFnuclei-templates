  description: The Frequently Asked Questions (faq) module allows users, with appropriate
    permissions, to create question and answer pairs which they want displayed on
    the faq page. The faq page is automatically generated from the FAQ nodes configured.
    Basic Views layouts are also provided and can be customised via the Views UI (rather
    than via the module settings page). The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize editor
    input leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability
    is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the create faq
    content permission.
