  description: 'The SureForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.1. This is due to the
    plugin distributing generic WordPress REST API nonces (wp_rest) to unauthenticated
    users via the ''wp_ajax_nopriv_rest-nonce'' action. While the plugin legitimately
    needs to support unauthenticated form submissions, it incorrectly uses generic
    REST nonces instead of form-specific nonces. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to bypass CSRF protection on REST API endpoints that rely solely on
    nonce verification without additional authentication checks, allowing them to
    trigger unauthorized actions such as the plugin''s own post-submission hooks and
    potentially other plugins'' REST endpoints.
