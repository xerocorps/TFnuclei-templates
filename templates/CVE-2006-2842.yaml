    cve-id: CVE-2006-2842
  description: 'PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in functions/plugin.php in
    SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc
    is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in
    the plugins array parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties,
    who state that Squirrelmail provides prominent warnings to the administrator when
    register_globals is enabled.  Since the varieties of administrator negligence
    are uncountable, perhaps this type of issue should not be included in CVE.  However,
    the original developer has posted a security advisory, so there might be relevant
    real-world environments under which this vulnerability is applicable.'
