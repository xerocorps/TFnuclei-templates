  description: 'The Advanced Category Template plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the _form.php file in versions up to, and including,
    0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. As the file also
    lacks a nonce check, this makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The file is also accessible
    directly but this is not exploitable in most configurations.
