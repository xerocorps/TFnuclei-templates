  description: "The Wordfence Security \u2013 Firewall & Malware Scan plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to and including\
    \ 7.6.0 via a setting on the options page due to insufficient escaping on the\
    \ stored value. This makes it possible for authenticated users, with administrative\
    \ privileges, to inject malicious web scripts into the setting that executes whenever\
    \ a user accesses a page displaying the affected setting on sites running a vulnerable\
    \ version.\n"
