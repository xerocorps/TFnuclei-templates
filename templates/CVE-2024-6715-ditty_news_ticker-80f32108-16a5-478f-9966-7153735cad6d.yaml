  description: "The Ditty \u2013 Responsive News Tickers, Sliders, and Lists plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Content\
    \ Title' field in versions 3.1.39 to 3.1.45 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was previously\
    \ patched as CVE-2024-3939 and was recently reintroduced.\n"
