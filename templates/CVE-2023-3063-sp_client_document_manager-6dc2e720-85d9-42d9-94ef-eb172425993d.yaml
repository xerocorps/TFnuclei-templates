  description: 'The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.67. This
    is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user
    bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to change user passwords and potentially
    take over administrator accounts.
