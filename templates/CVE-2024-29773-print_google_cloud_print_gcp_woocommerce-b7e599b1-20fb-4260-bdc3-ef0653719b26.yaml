  description: 'The BizPrint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.5.5. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation in the process.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to generate invoices containing malicious JavaScript via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. While the Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability was patched
    in version 4.5.4, making exploitation of cross-site scripting impractical, user
    inputs were not completely sanitized until version 4.5.6
