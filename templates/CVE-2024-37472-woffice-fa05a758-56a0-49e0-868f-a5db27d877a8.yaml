  description: "The Woffice theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018[function_or_param]\u2019 parameter in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 5.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
