  description: 'The WordPress Exit Strategy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.55. This is due the
    plugin not properly restricting direct access to the exitpage.php file. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web
    application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed
    is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for
    damage to an affected website.
