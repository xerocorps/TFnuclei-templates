    access of data and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the
    ''ajax_upload_file'' function in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and
    above, to upload a file to the contact, and then lists all the other uploaded
    files related to the contact.
