  description: 'The Restricted Site Access plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP
    Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 6.3.0. This is due to insufficient
    restrictions on where the IP Address information is being retrieved for user IP
    Addresses. This makes it possible for attackers to gain access to areas of the
    site that may have been restricted.
