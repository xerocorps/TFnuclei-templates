  description: 'The WP Responsive header image slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via ''sp_responsiveslider'' shortcode in versions
    up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
