  description: "The Geo Magazine Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018s\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action\
    \ such as clicking on a link."
