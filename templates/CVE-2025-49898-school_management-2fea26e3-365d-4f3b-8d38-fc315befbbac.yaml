  description: 'The School Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 93.2.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user
    supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with support staff-level access
    and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that
    can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
