  description: 'The Out Of Stock Badge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
