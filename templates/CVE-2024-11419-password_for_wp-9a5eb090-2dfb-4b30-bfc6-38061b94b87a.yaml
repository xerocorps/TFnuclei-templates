  description: 'The Password for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the get3_init_admin_page() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious
    web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
