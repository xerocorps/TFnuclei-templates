  description: 'The Piotnet Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the ''piotnetforms_ajax_form_builder''

    unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
