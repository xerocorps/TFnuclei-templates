  description: 'The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including,  5.0.12. This is due to insufficient
    verification on the user being supplied during the booking customer step. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user
    on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id. Note
    that logging in as a WordPress user is only possible if the "Use WordPress users
    as customers" setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. The vulnerability
    is partially patched in version 5.0.12 and fully patched in version 5.0.13.
