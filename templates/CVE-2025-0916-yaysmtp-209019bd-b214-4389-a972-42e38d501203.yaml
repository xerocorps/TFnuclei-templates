  description: 'The YaySMTP and Email Logs: Amazon SES, SendGrid, Outlook, Mailgun,
    Brevo, Google and Any SMTP Service plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions 2.4.9 to 2.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. Note: The vulnerability has been initially patched in version 2.4.8 and
    was reintroduced in version 2.4.9 with the removal of the wp_kses_post() built-in
    WordPress sanitization function.
