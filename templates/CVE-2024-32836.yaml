  description: 'The WP-Lister Lite for eBay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up
    to 3.6.0 (exclusive). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    shop manager-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
