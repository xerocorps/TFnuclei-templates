  description: 'The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the Services and Post Type Grid widgets in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.10.34 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
