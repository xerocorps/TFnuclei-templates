  description: 'The Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.9.2. This is due to the plugin not restricting
    what user meta can be updated as screen options. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges
    to that of an administrator. Please note that this only affects users with access
    to edit/update screen options, which means an administrator would need to grant
    lower privilege users with access to the Sent & Draft Emails page of the plugin
    in order for this to be exploited.
