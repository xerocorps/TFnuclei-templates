  description: The Enqueue Anything WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not have authorisation
    and CSRF checks in the remove_asset AJAX action, and does not ensure that the
    item to be deleted is actually an asset. As a result, low privilege users such
    as subscriber could delete arbitrary assets, as well as put arbitrary posts in
    the trash.
