  description: 'The String Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization
    of untrusted input via the ''string-locator-path'' parameter in versions up to,
    and including 2.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to call
    files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary
    PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted
    a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful
    in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
