  description: 'The Conditional Fields for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including,
    2.4.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
