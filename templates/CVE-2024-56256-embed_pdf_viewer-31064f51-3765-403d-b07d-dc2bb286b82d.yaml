  description: 'The Embed PDF Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
