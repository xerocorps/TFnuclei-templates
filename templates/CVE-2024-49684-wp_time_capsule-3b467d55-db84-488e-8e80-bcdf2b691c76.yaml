  description: 'The Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.22.21 via
    deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with administrator-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP
    chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an
    additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
    attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
