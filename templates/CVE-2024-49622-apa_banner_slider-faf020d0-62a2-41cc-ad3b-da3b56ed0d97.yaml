    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Apa Banner Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL used in a query via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. Since the result of such a query will be returned
    to the tricked user as opposed to the attacker, the severity of this vulnerability
    is reduced.
