  description: 'The AI WP Writer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.8.4.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the options() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update settings via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
