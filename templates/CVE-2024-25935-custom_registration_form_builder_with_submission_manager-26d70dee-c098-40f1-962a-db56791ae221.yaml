  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration,\
    \ Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request\
    \ Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5.9. This is due to missing\
    \ or incorrect nonce validation on the rm_options_default_payment_method() function.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the default payment\
    \ method via a forged request granted they can trick an authenticated site user\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
