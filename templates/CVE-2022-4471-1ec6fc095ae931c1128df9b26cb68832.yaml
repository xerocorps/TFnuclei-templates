  description: 'The YARPP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 5.30.2
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level and
    above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: It was found that an additional shortcode
    attribute (template) was vulnerable in versions <= 5.30.2. This was addressed
    in version 5.30.3.
