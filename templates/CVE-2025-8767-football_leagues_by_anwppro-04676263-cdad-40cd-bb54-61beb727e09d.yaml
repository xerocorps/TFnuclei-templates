  description: 'The AnWP Football Leagues plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 0.16.17 via the ''download_csv_players''
    and ''download_csv_games'' functions. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to embed untrusted input
    into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are
    downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
