  description: 'The Curvo Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation via the upload-handler.php file in all known
    versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
