  description: "The targets endpoint exposes services belonging to the infrastructure,\
    \ including their roles and labels. In addition to showing the target machine\
    \ addresses, the endpoint also exposes metadata labels that are added by the target\
    \ provider. These labels are intended to contain non-sensitive values, like the\
    \ name of the server or its description, but various cloud platforms may automatically\
    \ expose sensitive data in these labels, oftentimes without the developer\u2019\
    s knowledge."
