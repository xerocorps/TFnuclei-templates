    \ Scripting via the \u2018Ready Function\u2019 field in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.15.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page.\n"
