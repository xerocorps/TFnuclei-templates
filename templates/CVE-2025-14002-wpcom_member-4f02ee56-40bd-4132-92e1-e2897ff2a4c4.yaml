  description: 'The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass via brute force in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.16. This is due
    to weak OTP (One-Time Password) generation using only 6 numeric digits combined
    with a 10-minute validity window and no rate limiting on verification attempts.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to brute-force the verification
    code and authenticate as any user, including administrators, if they know the
    target''s phone number, and the target does not notice or ignores the SMS notification
    with the OTP.
