  description: 'The plugin External url as post Featured Image plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    2.02 due to the use of add_query_arg/remove_query_arg with insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via a URL that executes if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
