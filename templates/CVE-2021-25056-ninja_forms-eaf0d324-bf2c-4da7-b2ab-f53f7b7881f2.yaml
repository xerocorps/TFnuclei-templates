  description: 'The Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via field labels in versions up to, and including,
    3.6.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers with administrative level permissions and
    above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
