  description: 'The Ultimate Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.6.1. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various AJAX functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of tasks, such
    as deleting users and coupons, via forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
