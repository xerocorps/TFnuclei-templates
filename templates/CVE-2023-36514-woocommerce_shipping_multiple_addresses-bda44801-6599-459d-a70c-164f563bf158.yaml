  description: 'The WooCommerce Ship to Multiple Addresses plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.8.5.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
