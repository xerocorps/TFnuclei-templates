  description: "The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award\
    \ Winner \u2014 Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.2 via deserialization of untrusted\
    \ input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level\
    \ access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the\
    \ vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another\
    \ plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain\
    \ is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,\
    \ it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
