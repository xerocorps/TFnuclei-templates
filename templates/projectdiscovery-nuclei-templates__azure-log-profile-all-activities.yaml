  description: 'Ensure that the Log Profile created for your Azure cloud activity
    log is configured to collect logs for all the control and management activity
    categories, i.e. "Write", "Delete", and "Action", for security and compliance
    purposes. A Log Profile controls how the activity log is exported and retained
    within your Microsoft Azure cloud account.

    '
  impact: 'Failing to capture all activity categories can lead to incomplete logging
    information, which might hinder security audits and compliance checks, reducing
    the visibility into operations within the cloud environment.
