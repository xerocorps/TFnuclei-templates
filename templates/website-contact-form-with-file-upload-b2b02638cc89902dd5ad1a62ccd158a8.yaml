  description: 'The Website Contact Form With File Upload plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    upload_file function in versions before 1.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
