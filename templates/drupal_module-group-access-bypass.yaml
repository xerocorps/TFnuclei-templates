  description: The Group module has the ability to make content private to specific
    groups. When viewing a list of entities, e.g. nodes, a visitor should only see
    those entities that are either not attached to a group or that they have group
    access to. The module doesnt sufficiently enforce list access under the scenario
    where two users have the same outsider and insider permissions, but are members
    of different groups without any individual roles being assigned to said memberships.
    In such a scenario, the permissions hash for both will be the same even though
    it should differ. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker
    must have the same hash as someone else, which is quite rare yet not unthinkable.
