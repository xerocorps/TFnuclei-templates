  description: "The ARMember \u2013 Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member\
    \ Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP\
    \ Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.26 via deserialization\
    \ of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin.\
    \ If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the\
    \ target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code.\n"
