  description: 'The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information
    Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.0.80. This is due to the plugin
    exposing quiz answers through the ays_quiz_check_answer AJAX action without proper
    authorization checks. The endpoint only validates a nonce, but that same nonce
    is publicly available to all site visitors via the quiz_maker_ajax_public localized
    script data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive
    data including quiz answers for any quiz question.
