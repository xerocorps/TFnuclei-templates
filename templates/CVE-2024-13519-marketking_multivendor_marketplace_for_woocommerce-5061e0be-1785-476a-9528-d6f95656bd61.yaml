  description: "The MarketKing \u2014 Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace\
    \ Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via\
    \ plugin's settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.80 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Shop Manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected\
    \ page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html\
    \ has been disabled.\n"
