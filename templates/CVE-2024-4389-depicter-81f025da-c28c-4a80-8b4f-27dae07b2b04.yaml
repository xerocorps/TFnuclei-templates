  description: 'The Slider and Carousel slider by Depicter plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    uploadFile function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
