  description: "The Discount Rules for WooCommerce \u2013 Create Smart WooCommerce\
    \ Coupons & Discounts, Bulk Discount, BOGO Coupons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate\
    \ escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.5. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that execute if they can successfully trick a site administrator into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note that this is only\
    \ exploitable when the 'Leave a Review' notice is present, which occurs after\
    \ 100 orders are made and disappears after a user dismisses the notice.\n"
