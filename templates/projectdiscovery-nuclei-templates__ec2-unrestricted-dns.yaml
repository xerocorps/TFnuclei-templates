  description: 'Checks for inbound rules in Amazon EC2 security groups that allow
    unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) on TCP/UDP port 53, which can expose DNS
    servers to potential attacks.

    '
  impact: 'Allowing unrestricted access to DNS services can lead to DNS spoofing,
    DDoS attacks, and unauthorized access to internal networks.

    '
  name: Unrestricted DNS Access in EC2
  reference:
  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules
  remediation: 'Restrict the inbound rules for TCP/UDP port 53 in EC2 security groups
    to known, trusted IPs only. Ensure security group rules are tightly controlled
    and monitored.
