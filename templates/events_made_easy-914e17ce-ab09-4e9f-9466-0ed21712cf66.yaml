  description: 'The Events Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 1.5.50 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and missing nonce validation.
    This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page if they can successfully
    trick an admin into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
