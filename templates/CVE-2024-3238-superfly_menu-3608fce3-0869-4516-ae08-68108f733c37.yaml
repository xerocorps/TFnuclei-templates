  description: "The WordPress Menu Plugin \u2014 Superfly Responsive Menu plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 5.0.29. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the ajax_handle_delete_icons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to delete arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick\
    \ a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please\
    \ not the CSRF was patched in 5.0.28, however, adequate directory traversal protection\
    \ wasn't introduced until 5.0.30.\n"
