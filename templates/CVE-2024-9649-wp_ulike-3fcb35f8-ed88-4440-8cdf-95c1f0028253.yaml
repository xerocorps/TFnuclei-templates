  description: "The WP ULike \u2013 The Ultimate Engagement Toolkit for Websites plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 4.7.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the wp_ulike_delete_history_api() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to delete engagements via a forged request granted they can trick\
    \ a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
