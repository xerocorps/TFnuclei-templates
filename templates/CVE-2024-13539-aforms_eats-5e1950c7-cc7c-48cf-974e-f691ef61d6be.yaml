  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-13539
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    cvss-score: 5.3
  description: 'The AForms Eats plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is due the /vendor/aura/payload-interface/phpunit.php
    file being publicly accessible and displaying error messages. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application,
    which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful
    on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an
    affected website.
