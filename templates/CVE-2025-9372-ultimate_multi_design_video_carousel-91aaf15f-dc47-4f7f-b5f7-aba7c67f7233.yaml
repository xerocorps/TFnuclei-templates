  description: 'The Ultimate Multi Design Video Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
    affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
    disabled.
