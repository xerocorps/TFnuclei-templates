  description: 'The Backup by Supsystic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Download and Deletion in versions up to, and including, 2.3.11. This is due
    to various path traversal attacks and missing CSRF checks. This makes it possible
    for authenticated Admin+ attackers to download and delete any file on the vulnerable
    server and also allows unauthenticated attackers to delete files.
