  description: 'The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to insufficient authorization checks on the tp_extra_package_remove()
    function hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
    to delete arbitrary posts. While the patch for CVE-2023-5651 ensured subscriber-level
    users couldn''t delete arbitrary posts, the checks were not sufficient in preventing
    higher authenticated users such as contributors from deleting arbitrary posts.
