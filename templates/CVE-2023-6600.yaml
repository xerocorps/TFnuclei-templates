  description: 'The OMGF | GDPR/DSGVO Compliant, Faster Google Fonts. Easy. plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting due to a missing capability check on the update_settings() function
    hooked via admin_init in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.9. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings which
    can be used to inject Cross-Site Scripting payloads and delete entire directories.
    PLease note there were several attempted patched, and we consider 5.7.10 to be
    the most sufficiently patched.
