  description: 'The Simple Basic Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several of its settings parameters in versions
    up to, and including, 20220207 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
    and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
