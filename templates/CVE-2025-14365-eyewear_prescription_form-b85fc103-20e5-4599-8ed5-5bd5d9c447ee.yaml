  description: 'The Eyewear prescription form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.1. This is due
    to missing capability checks on the RemoveItems AJAX action. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary WooCommerce product categories,
    including all of their child categories, via the ''catIds'' parameter.
