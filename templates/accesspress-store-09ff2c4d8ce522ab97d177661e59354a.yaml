  description: 'A WordPress plugin and several WordPress themes developed by AccessPress
    Themes are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery via the plugin_activation_callback
    and plugin_deactivate_callback functions, called via AJAX actions, that were missing
    capability checks and nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to deactivate and activate arbitrary plugins, granted they could trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking a link. This could
    be used to deactivate security plugins and exploit other potential vulnerabilities.
