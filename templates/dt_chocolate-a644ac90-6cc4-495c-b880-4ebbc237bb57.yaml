    \ This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of TimThumb. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to send users to other websites if they\
    \ can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking a link\
    \ in addition to causing a loss of functionality on the site.\n"
