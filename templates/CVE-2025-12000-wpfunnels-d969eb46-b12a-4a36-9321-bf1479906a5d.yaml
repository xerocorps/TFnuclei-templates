  description: 'The WPFunnels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wpfnl_delete_log() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files
    on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file
    is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
