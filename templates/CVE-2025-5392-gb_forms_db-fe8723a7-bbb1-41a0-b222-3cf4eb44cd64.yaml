  description: 'The GB Forms DB plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 via the gbfdb_talk_to_front()
    function. This is due to the function accepting user input and then passing that
    through call_user_func(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to execute code on the server which can be leverage to inject backdoors or create
    new administrative user accounts to name a few things.
