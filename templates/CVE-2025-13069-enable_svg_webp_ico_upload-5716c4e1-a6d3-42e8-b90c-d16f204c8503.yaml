  description: 'The Enable SVG, WebP, and ICO Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is
    due to insufficient file type validation detecting ICO files, allowing double
    extension files with the appropriate magic bytes to bypass sanitization while
    being accepted as a valid ICO file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
