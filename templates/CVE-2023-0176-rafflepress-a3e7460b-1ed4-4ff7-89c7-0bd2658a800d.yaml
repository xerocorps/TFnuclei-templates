  description: 'The Giveaways and Contests by RafflePress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcodes in versions
    up to, and including, 1.11.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page
