  description: 'The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to missing capability checks on various functions hooked via AJAX actions
    in versions up to, and including, 4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level permissions and above to delete back-ups and view
    sensitive information about back-ups.
