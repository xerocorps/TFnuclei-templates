  description: 'The Xcare theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to 6.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any
    PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
    data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe" file types
    can be uploaded and included.
