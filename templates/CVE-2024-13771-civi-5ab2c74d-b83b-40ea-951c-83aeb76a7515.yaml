  description: 'The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and
    including, 2.1.4. This is due to a lack of user validation before changing a password.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the password of
    arbitrary users, including administrators, if the attacker knows the username
    of the victim.
