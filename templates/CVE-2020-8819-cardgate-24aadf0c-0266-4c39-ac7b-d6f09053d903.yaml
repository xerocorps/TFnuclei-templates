  description: 'An issue was discovered in the CardGate Payments plugin through 3.1.15
    for WooCommerce. Lack of origin authentication in the IPN callback processing
    function in cardgate/cardgate.php allows an attacker to remotely replace critical
    plugin settings (merchant ID, secret key, etc.) and therefore bypass the payment
    process (e.g., spoof an order status by manually sending an IPN callback request
    with a valid signature but without real payment) and/or receive all of the subsequent
    payments.
