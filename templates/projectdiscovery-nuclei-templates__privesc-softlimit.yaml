  description: 'The softlimit command is used in conjunction with the daemontools
    software to set resource limits for a process. It is commonly used to control
    the resource usage of a process, such as limiting its memory or CPU usage. The
    softlimit command helps in managing and controlling the resource consumption of
    a process, which can be useful for ensuring system stability and preventing resource
    exhaustion.
