  description: 'The Knews Multilingual Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the several functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL queries via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
