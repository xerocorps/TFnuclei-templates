  description: 'The Shopper Approved Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to
    a missing capability check on the ajax_callback_update_sa_option() function in
    versions 2.0 to 2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
    site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator
    and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
    to a vulnerable site.
