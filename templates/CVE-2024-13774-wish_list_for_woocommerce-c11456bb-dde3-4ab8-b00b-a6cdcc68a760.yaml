  description: 'The Wishlist for WooCommerce: Multi Wishlists Per Customer plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to,
    and including, 3.1.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on
    the ''save_to_multiple_wishlist'' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
