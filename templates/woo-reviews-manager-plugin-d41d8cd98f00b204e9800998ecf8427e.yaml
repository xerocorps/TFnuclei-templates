  description: 'The eBay Dropshipping and Affiliate by Wooshark plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on several
    functions located in the ~/woocommerce-reviews-manager_init.php file that are
    called via nopriv AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber level permissions and
    above to perform a wide variety of actions such as importing new products.
