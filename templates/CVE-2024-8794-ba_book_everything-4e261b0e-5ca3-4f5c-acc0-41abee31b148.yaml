  description: 'The BA Book Everything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    password reset in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.20. This is due to the
    reset_user_password() function not verifying a user''s identity prior to setting
    a password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset any
    user''s passwords, including administrators. It''s important to note that the
    attacker will not have access to the generated password, therefore, privilege
    escalation is not possible.
