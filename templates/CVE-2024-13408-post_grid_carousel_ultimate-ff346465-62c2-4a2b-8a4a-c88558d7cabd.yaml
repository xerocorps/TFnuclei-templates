  description: "The Post Grid, Slider & Carousel Ultimate \u2013 with Shortcode, Gutenberg\
    \ Block & Elementor Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.10 via the 'theme' attribute of the\
    \ `pgcu` shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing\
    \ the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php\
    \ files can be uploaded and included.\n"
