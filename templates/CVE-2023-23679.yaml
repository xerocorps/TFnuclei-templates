  description: The JS Help Desk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access to, modification of, and deletion data due to a missing capability check
    on multiple functions called by the 'ajaxhandler' function in versions up to,
    and including, 2.7.7. Although a nonce check is present in some functions, no
    capabilities are checked for individual tickets, so it is possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to use this nonce to perform
    actions such as accessing and modifying ticket data and deleting templates and
    images.
