  description: 'The Add Shortcodes Actions And Filters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.9. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on several functions such as settingsPage(). This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
