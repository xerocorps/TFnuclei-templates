  description: 'The Where Did You Hear About Us Checkout Field for WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via order meta in all
    versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop
    manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
