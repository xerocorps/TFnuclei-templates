  description: 'Ensure that the Application Insights feature is enabled for all your
    Microsoft Azure App Services applications in order to provide advanced application
    monitoring. Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management
    (APM) service for developers and DevOps professionals available as monitoring
    feature within Azure cloud. The feature monitors your live App Services applications
    to automatically detect performance anomalies. It includes powerful analytics
    tools to help diagnose issues and understand what users do with your application.
    Application Insights can be enabled for apps on various platforms including .NET,
    Node.js, and Java EE, hosted on-premises, hybrid, or other public cloud platforms.

    '
  impact: 'Not enabling Application Insights may lead to a lack of vital application
    performance data and missed opportunities for optimizing application responsiveness
    and troubleshooting issues.
