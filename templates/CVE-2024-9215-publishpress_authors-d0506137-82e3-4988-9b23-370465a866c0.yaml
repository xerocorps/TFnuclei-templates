  description: 'The Co-Authors, Multiple Authors and Guest Authors in an Author Box
    with PublishPress Authors plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct
    Object Reference to Privilege Escalation/Account Takeover in all versions up to,
    and including, 4.7.1 via the action_edited_author() due to missing validation
    on the ''authors-user_id'' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Author-level access and above, to update arbitrary user accounts
    email addresses, including administrators, which can then be leveraged to reset
    that user''s account password and gain access.
