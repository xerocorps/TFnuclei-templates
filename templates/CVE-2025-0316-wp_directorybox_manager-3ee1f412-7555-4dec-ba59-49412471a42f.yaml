  description: 'The WP Directorybox Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to incorrect
    authentication in the ''wp_dp_enquiry_agent_contact_form_submit_callback'' function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing
    user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.
