  description: The Clockstone theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload.php' file in versions
    up to, and including, 1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
    code execution possible.
