  description: 'The Yandex Metrica Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via plugin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.4.3
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
