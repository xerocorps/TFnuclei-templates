  description: 'The WPBot Pro Wordpress Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the qcld_openai_delete_training_file()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 13.6.2. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete
    arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
    when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
