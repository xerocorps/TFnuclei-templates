  description: 'The HDForms | Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.6.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code
    execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
