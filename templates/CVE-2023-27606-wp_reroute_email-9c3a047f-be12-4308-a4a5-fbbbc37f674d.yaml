  description: 'The WP Reroute Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in the settings.php file. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings via a forged request,
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
