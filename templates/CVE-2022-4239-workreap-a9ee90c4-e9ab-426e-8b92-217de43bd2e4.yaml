  description: 'The Workreap theme for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure direct
    object reference in versions up to, and including, 2.6.3. This is due to missing
    validation on if an addon service belongs to an individual making a request to
    the workreap_addons_service_remove action. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers to call arbitrary addon services and delete posts.
