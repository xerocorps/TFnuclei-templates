  description: 'The WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on several functions called via AJAX actions in the /lib/wpsp-ajaxworks.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a multitude
    of actions on behalf of other students or teachers, via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
