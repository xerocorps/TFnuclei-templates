  description: 'The Caddy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.7. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
