  description: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact
    Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in the iconRemove function in versions 2.0 to 2.13.4. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete
    arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
    when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
