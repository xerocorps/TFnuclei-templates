  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration,\
    \ Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2 due\
    \ to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations\
    \ where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
