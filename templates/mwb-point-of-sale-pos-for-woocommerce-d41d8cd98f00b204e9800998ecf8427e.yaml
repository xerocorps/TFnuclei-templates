  description: The MWB Point of Sale (POS) for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This
    is due to missing nonce validation and capability checks on several AJAX actions
    found within the plugin . This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with low-level privileges, such as subscriber, to execute otherwise restricted
    AJAX calls and modify the plugin's settings.
