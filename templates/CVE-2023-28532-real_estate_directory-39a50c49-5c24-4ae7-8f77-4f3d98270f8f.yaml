  description: 'The Real Estate Directory theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the rdm_activate_plugin function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
