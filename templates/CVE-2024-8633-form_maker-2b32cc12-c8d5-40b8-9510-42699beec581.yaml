  description: "The Form Maker by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact\
    \ Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.27 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
