  description: 'The RocketTheme''s Refraction Theme is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting,
    Content Spoofing, and Path Traversal in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This
    is due to inclusion of a vulnerable versions of RokBox and JW Player. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that
    execute in a victim''s browser, create fake content, and read the contents of
    arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. The theme
    directory can be named either ''refraction'' or ''rt_refraction_wp''.
