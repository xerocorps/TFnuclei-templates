  description: 'The AA-Team Premium SEO Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 via the ''file_content''
    parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers that include the
    default connection key to upload arbitrary files like shell scripts that can be
    used to execute code on the server. The plugin is also vulnerable to Local File
    Disclosure via the ''file'' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers who include the default connection key to read the contents of arbitrary
    files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
