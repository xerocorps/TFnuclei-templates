  description: 'The Woostify Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to add products and edit product quantities in a cart via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
