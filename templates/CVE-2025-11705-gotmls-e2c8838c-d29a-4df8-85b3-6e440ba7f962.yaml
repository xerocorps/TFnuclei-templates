  description: 'The Anti-Malware Security and Brute-Force Firewall plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 4.23.81
    due to a missing capability check combined with an information exposure in several
    GOTMLS_* AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on
    the server, which can contain sensitive information.
