  description: 'The Spam protection, Anti-Spam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized Arbitrary Plugin Installation due to an missing
    empty value check on the ''api_key'' value in the ''perform'' function in all
    versions up to, and including, 6.44. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to
    achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and activated.
