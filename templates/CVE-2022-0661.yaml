  description: The Ad Injection WordPress plugin through 1.2.0.19 does not properly
    sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged
    user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered_html
    disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further
    it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE)
    vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MOD constants
    are both set.
