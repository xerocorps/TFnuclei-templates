  description: 'The BNG Gateway For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.10. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, edit, and delete payment methods
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
