  description: 'The User Generator and Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to and including 1.2.2. This is due
    to missing nonce validation in the "Import Using CSV File" function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate user privileges by creating
    arbitrary accounts with administrator privileges via a forged request, provided
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
