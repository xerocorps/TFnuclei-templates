  description: 'The ARMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0.5. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the arm_check_user_cap function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to perform multiple unauthorized actions via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
