  description: The Shoppable Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions used to manipulate images.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform image manipulation
    tasks such as deletion, and delete arbitrary posts, granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
