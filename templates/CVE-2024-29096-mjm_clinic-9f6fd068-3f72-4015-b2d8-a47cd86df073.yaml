  description: 'The MJM Clinic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.22 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
    affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
    disabled.
