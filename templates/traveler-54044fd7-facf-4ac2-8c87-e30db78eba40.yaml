  description: 'The Travel Booking WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to
    both Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions
    up to, and including, 2.7.8.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link, and for authenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
