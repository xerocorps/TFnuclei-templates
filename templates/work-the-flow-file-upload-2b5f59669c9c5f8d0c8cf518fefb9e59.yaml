  description: 'The Work The Flow File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the jQuery-File-Upload-9.5.0
    server and test files in versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites
    server which may make remote code execution possible.
