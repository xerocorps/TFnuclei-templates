  description: 'The Contact Form By Mega Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
