  description: "The MStore API \u2013 Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 4.15.2. This is due to the use of loose comparison in the 'verify_id_token'\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as\
    \ any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access\
    \ to an @flutter.io email address or phone number. This also requires firebase\
    \ to be configured on the website and the user to have set up firebase for their\
    \ account.\n"
