  description: 'The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation within the td_ajax_get_views AJAX action. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
