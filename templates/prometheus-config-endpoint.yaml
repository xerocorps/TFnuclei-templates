  description: The config endpoint returns the loaded Prometheus configuration file.
    This file also contains addresses of targets and alerting/discovery services alongside
    the credentials required to access them. Usually, Prometheus replaces the passwords
    in the credentials config configuration field with the placeholder <secret> (although
    this still leaks the username).
