  description: 'Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
    Openfire''s administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable
    to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated
    user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured
    Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console
    reserved for administrative users. This vulnerability affects all versions of
    Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    gain unauthorized access to the Openfire Administration Console.
