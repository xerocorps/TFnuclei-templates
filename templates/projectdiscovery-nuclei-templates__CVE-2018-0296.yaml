  description: 'Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) web interfaces could allow
    an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly,
    resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is also possible on certain
    software releases that the ASA will not reload, but an attacker could view sensitive
    system information without authentication by using directory traversal techniques.
    The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation of the HTTP URL. An
    attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to
    an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition
    or unauthenticated disclosure of information. This vulnerability applies to IPv4
    and IPv6 HTTP traffic. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco
    Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco
    products: 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA), ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall,
    ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation
    Firewalls, ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco
    7600 Series Routers, Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Firepower 2100
    Series Security Appliance, Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliance, Firepower
    9300 ASA Security Module, FTD Virtual (FTDv). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi16029.

  impact: 'An attacker can read sensitive files on the Cisco ASA firewall, potentially
    leading to unauthorized access or information disclosure.
