  description: The Ultimate Auction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.0.5.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions and
    missing sanitization and escaping on several parameters. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise unauthorized access and perform
    subsequent attacks such as XSS via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
