  description: "The The Ultimate WordPress Toolkit \u2013 WP Extended plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wpext-export' parameter\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note\
    \ this fix was reverted in version 3.0.11 and later fixed again in version 3.0.13.\n"
