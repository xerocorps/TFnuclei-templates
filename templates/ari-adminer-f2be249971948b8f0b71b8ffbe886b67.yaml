  description: 'The ARI-Adminer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a lack of file access controls in nearly every file of the plugin
    in versions up to, and including, 1.1.14. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to call the files directly and perform a wide variety of unauthorized
    actions such as accessing a site''s database and making changes.
