  description: 'The Event Monster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.20. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation when processing AJAX actions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke these actions and perform actions like
    deleting all visitor records, via forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
