  description: 'The Export All Posts, Products, Orders, Refunds & Users plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
    including, 2.19. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `parseData`
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive
    information including user data, email addresses, password hashes, and WooCommerce
    data to an attacker-controlled file path on the server via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
