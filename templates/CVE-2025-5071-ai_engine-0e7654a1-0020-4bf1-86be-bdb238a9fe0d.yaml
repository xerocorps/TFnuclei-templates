  description: 'The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
    of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the ''Meow_MWAI_Labs_MCP::can_access_mcp''
    function in versions 2.8.0 to 2.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to have full access to the
    MCP and run various commands like ''wp_create_user'', ''wp_update_user'' and ''wp_update_option'',
    which can be used for privilege escalation, and ''wp_update_post'', ''wp_delete_post'',
    ''wp_update_comment'' and ''wp_delete_comment'', which can be used to edit and
    delete posts and comments.
