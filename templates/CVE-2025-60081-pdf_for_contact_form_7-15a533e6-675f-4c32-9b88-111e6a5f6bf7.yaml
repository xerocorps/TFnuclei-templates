    cvss-score: 7.5
  description: 'The PDF for Contact Form 7 + Drag and Drop Template Builder plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and
    including, 6.3.4 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject
    a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which
    means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing
    a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
    actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code
    depending on the POP chain present.
