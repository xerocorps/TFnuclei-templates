  description: 'The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cache Poisoning in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.48. This is due to
    the plugin not serving cached data from server-side responses and instead relying
    on user-input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to poison
    the cache location for location search results.
