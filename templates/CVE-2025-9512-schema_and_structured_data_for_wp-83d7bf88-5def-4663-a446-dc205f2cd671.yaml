  description: 'The Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via post comments in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.49 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
