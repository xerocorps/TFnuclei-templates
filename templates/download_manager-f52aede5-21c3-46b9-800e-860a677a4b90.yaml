  description: 'The WordPress Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.45. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the request of saving settings.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify administrative
    settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
