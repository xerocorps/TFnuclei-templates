  description: A WordPress plugin and several WordPress themes developed by AccessPress
    Themes are vulnerable to unauthorized plugin deactivation and activation via the
    plugin_activation_callback and plugin_deactivate_callback functions called via
    AJAX actions that were missing capability checks and nonce validation. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber,
    to deactivate and activate arbitrary plugins. This could be used to deactivate
    security plugins and exploit other potential vulnerabilities.
