  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure due to missing capability checks on the wel_check_progress_ajax AJAX
    action in versions up to, and including, 2.8.5. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level privileges or higher, to read certain log files
    maintained by the plugin leading to information disclosure. While the log file
    names are known and are directly accessible via browser on a server that is configured
    to serve .txt and .log files, the vulnerability allows attackers to access log
    files on other sites sharing the same server and also provides the ability to
    read such log files even if direct access is forbidden. Furthermore, the plugin
    is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the ''progressfile ''
    parameter. This makes it possible for attackers to call files using a PHAR wrapper,
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that
    can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also
    present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file
    with the serialized payload.
