  description: 'The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited
    JavaScript File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.9. This is due
    to a lack of proper checks on allowed file types. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers, with permissions granted by an administrator, to upload .css and .js
    files, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.
