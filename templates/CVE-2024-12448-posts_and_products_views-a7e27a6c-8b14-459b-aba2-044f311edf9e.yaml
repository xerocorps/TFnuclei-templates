  description: 'The Posts and Products Views for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''papvfwc_views''
    shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
