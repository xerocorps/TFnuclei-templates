  description: 'The User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to a hardcoded encryption key and missing file type validation
    on the ''ur_upload_profile_pic'' function in versions up to, and including, 3.0.2.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities
    or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible. This was partially patched in version 3.0.2 and
    fully patched in version 3.0.2.1.
