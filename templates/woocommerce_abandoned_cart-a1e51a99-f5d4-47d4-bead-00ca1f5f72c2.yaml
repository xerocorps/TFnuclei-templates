  description: 'The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.14.1. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''delete_expired_used_coupon_code''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete expired
    coupon codes granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
