  description: "The Happyforms \u2013 Form Builder for WordPress: Drag & Drop Contact\
    \ Forms, Surveys, Payments & Multipurpose Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.26.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
