  description: 'Intel Active Management platforms are susceptible to authentication
    bypass. A non-privileged network attacker can gain system privileges to provisioned
    Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard
    Manageability. A non-privileged local attacker can provision manageability features,
    gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability
    SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Standard Manageability, and Intel
    Small Business Technology. The issue has been observed in versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x
    9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 for all three platforms. Versions before 6 and
