  description: 'The Golo - City Travel Guide WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is
    vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.6.10. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s
    identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators, and
    leverage that to gain access to their account.
