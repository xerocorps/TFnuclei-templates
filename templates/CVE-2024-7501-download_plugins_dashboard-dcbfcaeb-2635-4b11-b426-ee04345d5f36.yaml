  description: 'The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.8.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_theme()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary
    themes from the website via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. In versions prior to 1.8.6
    it was possible to download the entire sites files.
