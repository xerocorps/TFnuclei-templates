  description: 'The Assistant for NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary directory deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the
    /wp-json/nextgenassistant/v1.0.0/control REST endpoint in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    delete arbitrary directories on the server, which can cause a complete loss of
    availability.
