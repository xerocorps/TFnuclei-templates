    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 4.4
  description: 'The Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.8.27 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled. CVE-2024-5968 may be a duplicate of this issue.
