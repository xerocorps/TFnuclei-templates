  description: 'Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress by LiquidThemes are vulnerable
    to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the liquid_reset_wordpress_before
    AJAX in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to deactivate all of a site''s plugins.
    While we escalated this to Envato after not being able to establish contact, it
    appears the developer added a nonce check, however that is not sufficient protection
    as the nonce is exposed to all users with access to the dashboard.
