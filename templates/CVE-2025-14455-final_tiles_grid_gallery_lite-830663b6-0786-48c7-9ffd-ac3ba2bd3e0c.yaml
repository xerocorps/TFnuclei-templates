  description: 'The Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.7. This is due
    to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform actions
    on gallery management functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Contributor-level access and above, to delete, modify, or clone galleries
    created by any user, including administrators.
