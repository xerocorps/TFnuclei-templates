  description: 'The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the ''st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
