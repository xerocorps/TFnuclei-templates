  description: 'The UrbanGo Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the plugin
    allowing users who are registering new accounts to set their own role or by supplying
    ''user_register_role'' field. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the administrator role.
