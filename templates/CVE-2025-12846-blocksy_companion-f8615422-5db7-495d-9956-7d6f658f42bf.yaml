  description: 'The Blocksy Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated
    arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.19. This is due
    to insufficient file type validation detecting SVG files, allowing double extension
    files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid SVG file. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with author level access and above, to
    upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
