  description: "The WP Travel Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.9.0. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
