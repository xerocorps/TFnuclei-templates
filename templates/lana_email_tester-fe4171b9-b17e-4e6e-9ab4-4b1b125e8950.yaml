  description: 'The Lana Email Tester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery and unauthorized Mail Relay in versions up to, and including,
    1.1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the lana_email_tester_send_test_wp_mail
    function as well as a missing capabilities check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to send emails from the site via forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link or via
    a properly crafted POST request to admin-post. This can also be exploited by authenticated
    users without requiring an administrator to perform an action.
