  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-13410
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 9.8
  description: 'The CozyStay and TinySalt plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to
    PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0, and in all versions
    up to, and including 3.9.0, respectively, via deserialization of untrusted input
    in the ''ajax_handler'' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software,
    which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing
    a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
    actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code
    depending on the POP chain present.
