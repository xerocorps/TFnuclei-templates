  description: 'The Spirit Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
    Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.13. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include
    and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any
    PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
    data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded
    and included.
