  description: 'The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''azh_add_post'', ''azh_duplicate_post'',
    ''azh_update_post'' and ''azh_remove_post'' functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to create, modify, and delete a post via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
