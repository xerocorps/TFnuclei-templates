  description: 'The InFocus Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion
    in versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due to the ''_mysite_delete_skin_zip''
    parameter in the ''dl-skin.php'' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete any file on the server of the vulnerable service.
