  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module enables you to accept payments from the Elavon payment
    provider. The module doesnt sufficiently verify that its communicating with the
    correct server when using the Elavon (On-site) payment gateway, which could lead
    to leaking valid payment details as well as accepting invalid payment details.
    This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be able to spoof
    the Elavon DNS received by your site.
