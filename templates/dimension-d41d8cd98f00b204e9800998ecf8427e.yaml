  description: The Dimension theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'upload-handler.php'
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted
    access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
