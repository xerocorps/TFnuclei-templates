    cvss-score: 4.2
  description: 'The Buddypress Force Password Change plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authenticated account takeover due to the plugin not properly validating a
    user''s identity prior to updating their password through the ''bp_force_password_ajax''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above and under certain
    prerequisites, to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators,
    and leverage that to gain access to their accounts.
