  description: "The Events Manager \u2013 Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 7.2.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the 'location_delete' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to delete locations via a forged request granted they can trick a\
    \ site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
