  description: "The WP 2FA \u2013 Two-factor authentication for WordPress plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 2.5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on\
    \ the send_backup_codes_email function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to send emails with arbitrary content to registered users via a forged\
    \ request granted they can trick a site administrator or other registered user\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While a nonce check is\
    \ present, it is only executed if a nonce is set. By omitting a nonce from the\
    \ request, the check can be bypassed.\n"
