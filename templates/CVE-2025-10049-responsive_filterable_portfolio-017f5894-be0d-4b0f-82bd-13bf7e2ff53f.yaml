  description: 'The Responsive Filterable Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the HdnMediaSelection_image
    field in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.24. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
