  description: "The Advanced Form Integration \u2013 Connect WooCommerce and Contact\
    \ Form 7 to Google Sheets and other platforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to SQL Injection via the \u2018integration_id\u2019 parameter in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.82.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied\
    \ parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries\
    \ into already existing queries and subsequently inject arbitrary web scripts\
    \ in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
