  description: 'The Recently viewed and most viewed products plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an unknown parameter in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
