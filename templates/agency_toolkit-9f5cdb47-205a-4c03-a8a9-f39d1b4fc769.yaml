  description: 'The Agency Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability
    check on the ''agency_toolkit_import'' action in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.23. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary
    options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role
    for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to
    gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. CVE-2024-56066 is a duplicate
    of this.
