  description: 'The Lock User Account plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to user lock
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to permitting
    application password logins when user accounts are locked. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with existing application passwords, to interact
    with the vulnerable site via an API such as XML-RPC or REST despite their account
    being locked.
