  description: 'The WP Job Board Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation in all versions up to 2.3.16. This is due to the plugin allowing a
    user to supply the ''role'' field when registering. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator on vulnerable sites.
    Please note that this may have been patched sooner, however, the oldest available
    version for us to confirm this is patched in was 1.2.85.
