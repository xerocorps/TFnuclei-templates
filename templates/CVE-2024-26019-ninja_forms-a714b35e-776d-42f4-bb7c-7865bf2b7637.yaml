  description: "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form fields\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will\
    \ execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site\
    \ installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
