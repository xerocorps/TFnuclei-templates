  description: "The Flo Forms \u2013 Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file uploads in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.0.43. This is due to the plugin allowing SVG file uploads\
    \ via an unauthenticated AJAX endpoint (`flo_form_submit`) without proper file\
    \ content validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript that executes when an administrator\
    \ views the uploaded file in the WordPress admin interface, leading to potential\
    \ full site compromise.\n"
