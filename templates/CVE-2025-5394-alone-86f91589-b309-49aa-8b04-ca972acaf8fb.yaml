  description: "The Alone \u2013 Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme theme\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability\
    \ check on the alone_import_pack_install_plugin() function in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 7.8.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to upload zip files containing webshells disguised as plugins from remote locations\
    \ to achieve remote code execution. CVE-2025-54019 is likely a duplicate of this.\n"
