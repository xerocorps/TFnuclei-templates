  description: "The Motors \u2013 Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file\
    \ path validation when deleting profile pictures in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.4.89. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level\
    \ access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily\
    \ lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
