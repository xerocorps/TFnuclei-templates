  description: "The InstaWP Connect \u2013 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 0.1.0.44. This is due to insufficient verification of the API key.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing\
    \ user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username,\
    \ and to perform a variety of other administrative tasks. NOTE: This vulnerability\
    \ was partially fixed in 0.1.0.44, but was still exploitable via Cross-Site Request\
    \ Forgery.\n"
