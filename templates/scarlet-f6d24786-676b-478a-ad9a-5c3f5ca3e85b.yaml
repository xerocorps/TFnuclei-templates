  description: 'The Scarlet theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions due to the inclusion of a vulnerable version of ZeroClipboard.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
