  description: 'Multiple plugins for WordPress by emarket-design with the ''emd-form-builder-lite''
    package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in various versions via the emd_form_builder_lite_pagenum
    function. This is due to the plugin not properly validating user input before
    using it as a function name. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to execute code on the server, however, parameters can not be passed to the functions
    called
