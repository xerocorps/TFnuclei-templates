  description: 'The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on ''save'', ''delete'', ''deleteLang'',
    and ''saveLang'' functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This could
    lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions
    to save or delete plugin data that can potentially lead to injected arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
