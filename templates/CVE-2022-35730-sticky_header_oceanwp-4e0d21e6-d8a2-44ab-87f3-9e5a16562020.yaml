  description: 'The Oceanwp sticky header plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_page function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin''s style settings, via forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
