  description: "The Bit File Manager \u2013 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and\
    \ Code Editor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file\
    \ uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload' function in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 6.5.5. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted upload permissions\
    \ by an administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server\
    \ which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
