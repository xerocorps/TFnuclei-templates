  description: 'The Workreap plugin for WordPress, used by the Workreap - Freelance
    Marketplace WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions
    up to, and including, 3.3.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
    a user''s identity prior to logging them in when verifying an account with an
    email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in
    as registered users, including administrators, if they know user''s email address.
    This is only exploitable fi the user''s confirmation_key has not already been
    set by the plugin.
