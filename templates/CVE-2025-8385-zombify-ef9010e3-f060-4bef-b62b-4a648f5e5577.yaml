  description: 'The Zombify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in
    all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This is due to insufficient input validation
    in the zf_get_file_by_url function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on the server,
    including sensitive system files like /etc/passwd, via a forged request. It''s
    worth noting that successfully exploiting this vulnerability relies on a race
    condition as the file generated will be deleted immediately.
