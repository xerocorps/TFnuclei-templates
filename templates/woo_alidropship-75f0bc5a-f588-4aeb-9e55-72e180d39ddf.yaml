  description: 'The ALD Dropping and Fulfillment for AliExpress and WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data in
    versions up to, and including, 1.0.21. This is due to missing capability checks
    on several functions such as the ''update_ali_order_id'', ''ob_get_clean'', and
    ''get_ali_order_detail'' functions to name a few. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to retrieve order information or possibly make (minor) changes to an
    order.
