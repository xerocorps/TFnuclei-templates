  description: 'Ensure that your Amazon CloudFormation stacks are using SNS topics
    to send notifications when important events occur.

    '
  impact: 'Disabling CloudFormation Stack Notifications can lead to reduced visibility
    into stack events and errors, delaying the detection of issues and hindering effective
    monitoring of changes and deployments in the cloud environment.

  remediation: 'Enable CloudFormation Stack Notifications by configuring SNS (Simple
    Notification Service) topics for your CloudFormation stack. This will ensure real-time
    alerts on stack events, including updates, errors, and resource creation, providing
    better monitoring and visibility.
