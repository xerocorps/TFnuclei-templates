  description: 'The Year Make Model Search for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.11.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the execute() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
