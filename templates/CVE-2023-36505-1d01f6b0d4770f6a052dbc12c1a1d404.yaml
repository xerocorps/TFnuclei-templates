  description: 'The Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletions in versions up to, and including, 3.6.24. This is due to insufficient
    restriction on the file path that can be supplied during file deletion. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level access, to
    delete arbitrary files on the server. One such file that could be targeted is
    wp-config.php which if deleted can make it possible for an attacker to connect
    a site to their own database and ultimately achieve remote code execution on the
    server.
