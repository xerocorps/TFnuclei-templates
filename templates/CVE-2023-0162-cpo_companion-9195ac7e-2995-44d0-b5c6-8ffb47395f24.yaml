  description: 'The CPO Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via several of its content type settings parameters in versions up to,
    and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
