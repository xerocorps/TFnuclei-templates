  description: 'The AHAthat Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.6 due to insufficient escaping on the
    user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL
    query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
    access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries
    that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
