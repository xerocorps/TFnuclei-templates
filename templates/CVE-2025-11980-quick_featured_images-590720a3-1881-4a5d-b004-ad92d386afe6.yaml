  description: 'The Quick Featured Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL
    Injection via the ''delete_orphaned'' function in all versions up to, and including,
    13.7.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of
    sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database, granted they can convince an author-level user or higher to
    add a malicious custom field value.
