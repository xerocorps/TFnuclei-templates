  description: 'The Yellow Yard Searchbar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s yy_filter and yy_filter_container shortcodes
    in versions up to, and including, 2.7.27 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
