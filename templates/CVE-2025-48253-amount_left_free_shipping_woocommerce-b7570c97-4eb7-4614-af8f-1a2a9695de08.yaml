  description: 'The Free Shipping Bar: Amount Left for Free Shipping for WooCommerce
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions
    up to, and including, 2.4.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
