  description: 'WordPress Core in versions up to 6.0.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting via wp-mail.php. This is due to no validation on what level the user
    was sending the email post and therefore did not perform any sanitization on the
    submitted post data. This meant that users without the unfiltered_html capability,
    with access to submitting posts via email, could inject malicious JavaScript into
    posts that would execute whenever someone accessed the post.
