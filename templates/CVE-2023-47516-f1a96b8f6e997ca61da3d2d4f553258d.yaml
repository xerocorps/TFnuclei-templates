  description: 'The Category Post List Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the get_cplw_settings function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin''s settings,
    including injecting XSS, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
