  description: 'The R Animated Icon Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the
    SVG file.
