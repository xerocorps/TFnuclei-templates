  description: "The Post Grid, Form Maker, Popup Maker, WooCommerce Blocks, Post Blocks,\
    \ Post Carousel \u2013 Combo Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the 'tag' attribute in blocks in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 2.2.80 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page.\n"
