  description: "The Team Members \u2013 Best WordPress Team Plugin with Team Slider,\
    \ Team Showcase & Team Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object\
    \ Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.4 via deserialization of\
    \ untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the\
    \ vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another\
    \ plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain\
    \ is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,\
    \ it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
