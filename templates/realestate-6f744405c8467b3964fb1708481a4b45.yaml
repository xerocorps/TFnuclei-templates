  description: The Realestate theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads via CSRF due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'upload-file.php'
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
