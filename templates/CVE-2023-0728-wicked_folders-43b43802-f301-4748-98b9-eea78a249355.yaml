  description: 'The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_save_folder function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link leading them to perform actions intended for administrators
    such as changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin.
