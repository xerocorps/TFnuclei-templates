  description: 'The WP Lead Plus X plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.99. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to perform administrative actions, such as adding pages
    to the site and/or replacing site content with malicious JavaScript via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
