  description: 'The Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized execution of AJAX actions by subscriber level users and above
    in versions up to, and including 1.2.3. This is due to missing capability checks
    on the various functions hooked via AJAX actions in the plugin and can lead to
    attackers performing a variety of unauthorized actions.
