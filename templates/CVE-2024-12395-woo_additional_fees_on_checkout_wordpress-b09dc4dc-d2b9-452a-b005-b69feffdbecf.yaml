  description: "The WooCommerce Additional Fees On Checkout (Free) plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018number\u2019 parameter\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
