  description: "The My auctions allegro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local\
    \ File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.32 via the 'controller'\
    \ parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and\
    \ execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code\
    \ in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
