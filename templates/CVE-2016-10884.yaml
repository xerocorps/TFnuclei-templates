  description: The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to multiple
    Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to gain administrative access and perform otherwise restricted actions
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
