  description: "The WP Dark Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File\
    \ Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 4.0.7 via the 'style' shortcode\
    \ attribute. This allows authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions\
    \ and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the\
    \ execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included. This only\
    \ affects installations where the traversal of non-existent directories is allowed\
    \ or when chained with another vulnerability that allows for the creation of arbitrary\
    \ directories.\n"
