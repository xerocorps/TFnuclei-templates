    cvss-score: 4.3
  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access of sensitive information in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.32.
    This is due to missing authorization and capability checks on the `wpdm_media_access`
    AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to retrieve passwords and access control settings for protected
    media attachments, which can then be used to bypass the intended media protection
    and download restricted files.
