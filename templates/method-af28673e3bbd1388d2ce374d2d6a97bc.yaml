  description: The Method Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion
    in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to the '_mysite_delete_skin_zip'
    parameter in the 'dl-skin.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete any file on the server of the vulnerable service.
