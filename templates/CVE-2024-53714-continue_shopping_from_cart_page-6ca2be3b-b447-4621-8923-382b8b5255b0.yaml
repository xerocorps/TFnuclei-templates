  description: 'The Continue Shopping From Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unknown action granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link. Missing sanitization of user input allows an attacker to inject malicious
    JavaScript into the database.
