  description: 'The All in One SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.2.3.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to execute them, via forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
