  description: 'Several plugins for WordPress by wpcodefactory are vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
