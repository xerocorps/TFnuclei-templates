  description: 'The myCred plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.9.4.3 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
