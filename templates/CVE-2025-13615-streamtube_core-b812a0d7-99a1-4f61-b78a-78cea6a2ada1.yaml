  description: 'The StreamTube Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 4.78. This is due to the
    plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization
    and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note:
    This can only be exploited if the ''registration password fields'' enabled in
    theme options.
