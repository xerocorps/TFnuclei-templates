  description: 'The Pexels: Free Stock Photos plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''pexels_fsp_images_options_validate''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
