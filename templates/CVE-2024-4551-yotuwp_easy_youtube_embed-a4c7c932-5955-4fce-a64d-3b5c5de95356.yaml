  description: "The Video Gallery \u2013 YouTube Playlist, Channel Gallery by YotuWP\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.3.13 via the display function. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with contributor access and higher, to include and\
    \ execute arbitrary php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
