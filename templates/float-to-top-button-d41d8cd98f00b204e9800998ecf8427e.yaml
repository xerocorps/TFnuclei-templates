  description: The Float to Top Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters such as 'arrow_img_url' in versions
    up to, and including, 2.3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping that makes attribute based XSS possible. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with administrative level permissions and above to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
