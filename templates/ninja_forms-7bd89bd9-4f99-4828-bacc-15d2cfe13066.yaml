  description: 'The Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.9.28 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping during form submission. This makes it possible
    for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
