  description: "The Academy LMS \u2013 WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning\
    \ Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 3.3.8 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'import_all_courses'\
    \ function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the\
    \ vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another\
    \ plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain\
    \ is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,\
    \ it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
