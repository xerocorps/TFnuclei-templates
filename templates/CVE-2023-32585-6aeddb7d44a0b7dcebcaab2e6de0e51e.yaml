  description: "The Portfolio Gallery \u2013 Responsive Image Gallery plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing\
    \ capability check on the TotalSoftPortfolio_Del_Callback() function called via\
    \ an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary galleries. Please note there\
    \ are many additional AJAX actions that are also vulnerable and can be used to\
    \ perform other actions like cloning galleries and editing limited details for\
    \ them.\n"
