  description: 'The Photo Gallery ( Responsive ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to achieve privilege escalation granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
    The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
