  description: 'The Ajax Search Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.18.7. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in one of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke the vulnerable function via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. Sanitization and escaping of user input is insufficient resulting
    in Stored Cross-Site Scripting.
