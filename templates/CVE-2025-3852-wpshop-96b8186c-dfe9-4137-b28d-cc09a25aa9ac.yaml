  description: "The WPshop 2 \u2013 E-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.0 to 2.6.0. This\
    \ is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating\
    \ their details like email & password through the update() function. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,\
    \ to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage\
    \ that to gain access to their account.\n"
