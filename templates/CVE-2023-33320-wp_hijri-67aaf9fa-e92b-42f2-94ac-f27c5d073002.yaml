  description: 'The WP-Hijri plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''month'' and ''year'' parameter in versions up to, and including,
    1.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, granted the attacker
    can trick the user into performing an action such as clicking on a link..
