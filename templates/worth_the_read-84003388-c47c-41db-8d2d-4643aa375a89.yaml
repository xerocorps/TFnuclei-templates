  description: 'The Appsero analytics tool used in several plugins is vulnerable to
    authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the uninstall_reason_submission
    function used for feedback submission in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
    and above, to invoke this function intended for administrator use.
