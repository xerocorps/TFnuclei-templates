  description: 'The Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2 due to insufficient validation
    on the webhook feature. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations
    originating from the web application which can be used to query and modify information
    from internal services.
