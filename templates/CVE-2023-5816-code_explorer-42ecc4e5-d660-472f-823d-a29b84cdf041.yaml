  description: 'The Code Explorer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    external file reading in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This is due
    to the fact that the plugin does not restrict accessing files to those outside
    of the WordPress instance, though the intention of the plugin is to only access
    WordPress related files. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access, to read files outside of the WordPress instance.
