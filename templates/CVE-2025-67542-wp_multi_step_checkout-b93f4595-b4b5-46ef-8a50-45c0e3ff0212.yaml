  description: 'The Multi-Step Checkout for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.33 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
