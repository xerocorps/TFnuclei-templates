  description: 'The Resize at Upload Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation when saving settings. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
