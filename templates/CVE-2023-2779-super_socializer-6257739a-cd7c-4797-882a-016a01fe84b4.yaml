  description: 'The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the $targetUrls value in versions
    up to, and including, 7.13.51 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
