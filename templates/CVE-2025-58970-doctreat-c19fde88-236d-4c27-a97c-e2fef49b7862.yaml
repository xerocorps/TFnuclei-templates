  description: 'The The Doctreat - Hospitals and Doctors Directory WordPress Listing
    Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all
    versions up to, and including, 1.6.7. This is due to the software allowing users
    to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
    and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
