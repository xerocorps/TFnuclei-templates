  description: 'The Add Google +1 (Plus one) social share Button plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the google-plus-one-share-button
    page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings
    and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
