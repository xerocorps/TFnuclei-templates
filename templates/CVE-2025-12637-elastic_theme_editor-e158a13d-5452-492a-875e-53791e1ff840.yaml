  description: 'The Elastic Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to a dynamic code generation feature in the process_theme function
    in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
