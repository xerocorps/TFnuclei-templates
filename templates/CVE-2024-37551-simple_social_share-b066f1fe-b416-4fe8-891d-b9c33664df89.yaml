    cvss-score: 4.4
  description: 'The Simple Social Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.0 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
