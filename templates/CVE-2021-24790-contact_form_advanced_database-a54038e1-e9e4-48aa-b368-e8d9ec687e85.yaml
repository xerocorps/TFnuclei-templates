  description: 'The Contact Form Advanced Database WordPress plugin through 1.0.8
    does not have any authorisation as well as CSRF checks in its delete_cf7_data
    and export_cf7_data AJAX actions, available to any authenticated users, which
    could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to call them. The delete_cf7_data
    would lead to arbitrary metadata deletion, as well as PHP Object Injection if
    a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin, as user data is passed to
    the maybe_unserialize() function without being first validated.
