  description: 'The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.9.9. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the fifu_update_menu_options function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger plugin options
    updates via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
