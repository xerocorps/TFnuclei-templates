  description: 'SILENTTRINITY is modern, asynchronous, multiplayer & multiserver C2/post-exploitation
    framework powered by Python 3 and .NETs DLR. It''s the culmination of an extensive
    amount of research into using embedded third-party .NET scripting languages to
    dynamically call .NET API''s, a technique the author coined as BYOI (Bring Your
    Own Interpreter). The aim of this tool and the BYOI concept is to shift the paradigm
    back to PowerShell style like attacks (as it offers much more flexibility over
    traditional C# tradecraft) only without using PowerShell.
