  description: 'The Etsy Shop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the etsy_shop_options_page function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. Version 3.0.3 included a partial fix.
