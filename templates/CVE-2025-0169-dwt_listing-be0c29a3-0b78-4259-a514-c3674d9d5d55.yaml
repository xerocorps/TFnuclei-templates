  description: 'The DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and
    above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
