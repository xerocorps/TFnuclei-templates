  description: 'The GiveWP for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
    in versions up to, and including, 2.25.2. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the give_donation_import_callback function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to process the import of donations via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
