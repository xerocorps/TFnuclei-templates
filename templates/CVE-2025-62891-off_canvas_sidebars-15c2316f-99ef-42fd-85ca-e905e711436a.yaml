  description: 'The Off-Canvas Sidebars & Menus (Slidebars) plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.5.8.5.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
