  description: 'The WP Webhooks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    copy due to missing validation of user-supplied input in all versions up to, and
    including, 3.3.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to copy
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server to arbitrary locations. This can
    be used to copy the contents of wp-config.php into a text file which can then
    be accessed in a browser to reveal database credentials.
