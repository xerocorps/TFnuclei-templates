  description: 'The Plugin Central plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php), granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
