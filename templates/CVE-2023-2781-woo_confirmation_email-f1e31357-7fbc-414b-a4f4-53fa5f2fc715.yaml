  description: 'The User Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to authentication bypass via authenticate_user_by_email in versions
    up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to a random token generation weakness
    in the resend_verification_email function. This allows unauthenticated attackers
    to impersonate users and trigger an email address verification for arbitrary accounts,
    including administrative accounts, and automatically be logged in as that user,
    including any site administrators. This requires the Allow Automatic Login After
    Successful Verification setting to be enabled, which it is not by default.
