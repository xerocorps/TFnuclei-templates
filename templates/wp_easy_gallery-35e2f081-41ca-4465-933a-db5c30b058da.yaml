  description: "The WP Easy Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic\
    \ SQL Injection via the 'galleryId' or 'select_gallery' parameters found in the\
    \ \u2018admin/edit-gallery.php\u2019 file in versions up to, and including, 2.7\
    \ due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient\
    \ preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ admin+ attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries\
    \ that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n"
