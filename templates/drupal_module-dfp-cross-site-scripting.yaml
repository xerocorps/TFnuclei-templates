  description: Doubleclick for Publishers (DFP) module enables a site to place ads
    from Doubleclick For Publishers. The module doesnt sanitize user input in certain
    cases, which leads to Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker
    that can create or edit certain entities may be able to exploit a Cross-Site-Scripting
    (XSS) vulnerability to target visitors of the site, including site admins with
    privileged access. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker
    must have a role with the permission administer DFP.
