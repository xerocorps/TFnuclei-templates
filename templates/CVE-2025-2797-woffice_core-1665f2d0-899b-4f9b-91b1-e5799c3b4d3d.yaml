  description: 'The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.21. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''woffice_handle_user_approval_actions''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve registration
    for any user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
