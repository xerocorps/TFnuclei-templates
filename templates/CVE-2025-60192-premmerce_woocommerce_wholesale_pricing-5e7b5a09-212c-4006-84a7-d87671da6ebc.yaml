  description: 'The Premmerce Wholesale Pricing for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.1.10.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary
    files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
    can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
    execution in cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and
    included.
