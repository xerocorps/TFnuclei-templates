  description: 'The The InPost Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    shortcode execution via the inpost_gallery_get_shortcode_template AJAX action
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4.2. This is due to the software allowing
    users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running
    do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
