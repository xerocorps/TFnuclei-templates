  description: 'The Responsive and Swipe slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s rsSlider shortcode in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
