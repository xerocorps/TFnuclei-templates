  description: "The Popup More Popups, Lightboxes, and more popup modules plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in version 2.1.6 via the ycfChangeElementData()\
    \ function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files ending with \"Form.php\"\
    \ on the server , allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This\
    \ can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code\
    \ execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be\
    \ uploaded and included.\n"
