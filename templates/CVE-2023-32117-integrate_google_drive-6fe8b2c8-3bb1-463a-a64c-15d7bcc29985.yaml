  description: 'The Integrate Google Drive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access due to a missing capability check on several REST API endpoints in versions
    up to, and including, 1.1.99. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to perform a wide variety of operations, such as moving files, creating folders,
    copying details, and much more.
