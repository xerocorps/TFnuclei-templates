  description: 'The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload - Contact Form 7 plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type
    validation in the ''dnd_upload_cf7_upload'' function in versions up to, and including,
    1.3.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
    This can be exploited if a user authorized to edit form, which means editor privileges
    or above, has added a ''multiple file upload'' form field with ''*'' acceptable
    file types.
