  description: 'The FULL - Customer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Upload via the /install-plugin REST route in versions up to, and including,
    2.2.3 due to improper authorization. This allows authenticated attackers with
    subscriber-level permissions and above to execute code by installing plugins from
    arbitrary remote locations including non-repository sources onto the site, granted
    they are packaged as a valid WordPress plugin.
