  description: 'The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Scripting by using the ''fname'' attribute of the ''mf_thankyou''
    shortcode to echo unescaped form submissions in versions up to, and including,
    3.3.0. This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions
    or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when the
    victim visits a a page containing the shortcode when the submission id is present
    in the query string. Note that getting the JavaScript to execute requires user
    interaction as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but
    the script itself is stored in the site database. Additionally this requires successful
    payment, increasing the complexity.
