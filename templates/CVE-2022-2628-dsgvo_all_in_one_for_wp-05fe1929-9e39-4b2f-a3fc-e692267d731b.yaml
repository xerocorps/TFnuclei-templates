  description: "The DSGVO All in one for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018dsdvo_customimprinttext\u2019 parameter\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. \n4.2. was intended\
    \ to provide a fix, but does not sufficiently address this issue.\n"
