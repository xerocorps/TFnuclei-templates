  description: 'The Social Sharing Plugin - Social Warfare plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via ''social_warfare'' shortcode in
    versions up to, and including, 4.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
