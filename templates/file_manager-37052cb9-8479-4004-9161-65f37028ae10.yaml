  description: 'The Bit File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the plugin''s upload form. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
