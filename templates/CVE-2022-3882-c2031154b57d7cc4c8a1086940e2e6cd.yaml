  description: 'The Memory Usage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the wpmemory_install_plugin() function
    in versions up to, and including, 2.45. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with minimal permission, such as a subscriber, to install arbitrary
    plugins on the vulnerable site. This could be used to install additional vulnerable
    plugins that could aid in further compromise of the site.
