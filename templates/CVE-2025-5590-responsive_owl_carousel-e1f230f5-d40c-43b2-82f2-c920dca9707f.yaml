  description: "The Owl carousel responsive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ time-based SQL Injection via the \u2018id\u2019 parameter in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter\
    \ and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it\
    \ possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used\
    \ to extract sensitive information from the database.\n"
