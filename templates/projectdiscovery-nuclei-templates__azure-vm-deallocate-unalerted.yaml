  description: 'Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is fired whenever "Deallocate
    Virtual Machine" events are triggered within your Microsoft Azure cloud account.
    An Azure activity log alert is triggered when a new activity log event that matches
    the condition specified in the alert configuration occurs. For this conformity
    rule, the matched condition is `Whenever the Administrative Activity Log "Deallocate
    Virtual Machine (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines)" has "any" Event level, with
    "any" Status and Event initiated by "any"`.

    '
  impact: 'Without an alert for "Deallocate Virtual Machine" events, unauthorized
    or unintended shutdowns of VMs may occur without detection, leading to potential
    disruptions and security risks.

    Machine" events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate/action"
    and ensuring that alerts trigger notifications appropriately.
