  description: "The WP Shortcodes Plugin \u2014 Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 7.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the preview function.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes\
    \ via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link. In combination with CVE-2025-7354, it\
    \ leads to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.\n"
