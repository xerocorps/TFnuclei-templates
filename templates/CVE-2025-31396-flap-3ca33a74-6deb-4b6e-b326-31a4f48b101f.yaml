  description: 'The FLAP - Business WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.5 via deserialization
    of untrusted input [from the vulnerable parameter?|in the vulnerable function?].
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No
    known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present
    via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow
    the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
