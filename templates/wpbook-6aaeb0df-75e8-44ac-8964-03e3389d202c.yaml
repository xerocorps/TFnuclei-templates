  description: 'The WPBook plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7. This is due to missing nonce validation
    on the wpbook_subpanel() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to modify a vulnerable sites Facebook connection via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
