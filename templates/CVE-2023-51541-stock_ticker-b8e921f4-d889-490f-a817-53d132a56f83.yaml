  description: 'The Stock Ticker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 3.23.4 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
