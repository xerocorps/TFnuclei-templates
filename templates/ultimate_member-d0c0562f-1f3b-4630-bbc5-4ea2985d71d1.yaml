  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via an uploaded file''s name from a user profile upload in versions
    up to, and including, 2.0.45 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for low-level authenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
