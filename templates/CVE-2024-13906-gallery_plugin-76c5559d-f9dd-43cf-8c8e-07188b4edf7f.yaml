  description: "The Gallery by BestWebSoft \u2013 Customizable Image and Photo Galleries\
    \ for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in\
    \ all versions up to, and including, 4.7.3 via deserialization of untrusted input\
    \ in the 'import_gallery_from_csv' function. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object.\
    \ No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability\
    \ has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed\
    \ on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed\
    \ on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete\
    \ arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP\
    \ chain present.\n"
