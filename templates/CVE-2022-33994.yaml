  description: The Gutenberg  plugin for WordPress has been reported to be vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 13.7.3 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to embed
    remote SVG files as images in blog posts. As these files use <img> tags, no code
    can be executed in the context of the WordPress site. However, if the attacker
    can get a victim to visit the remotely hosted SVG file then any JavaScript in
    that file will execute in their browser in the context of the remote site.
