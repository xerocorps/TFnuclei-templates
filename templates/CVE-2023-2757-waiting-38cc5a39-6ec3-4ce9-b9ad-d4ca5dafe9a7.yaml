  description: 'The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on ''saveLang'' functions
    in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save plugin data that can
    potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
