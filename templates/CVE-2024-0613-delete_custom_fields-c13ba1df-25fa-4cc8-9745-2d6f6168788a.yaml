  description: 'The Delete Custom Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.3.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_delete_field() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary post meta data via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
