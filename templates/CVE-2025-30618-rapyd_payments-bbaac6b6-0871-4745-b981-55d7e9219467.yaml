  description: 'The Rapyd Payment Extension for WooCommerce theme for WordPress is
    vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9 via
    deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
    software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code.
