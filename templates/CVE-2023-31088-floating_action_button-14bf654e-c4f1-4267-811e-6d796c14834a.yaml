  description: 'The Floating Action Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, <=1.2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''wp_ajax_fz_fab_settings_save'' AJAX action.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
