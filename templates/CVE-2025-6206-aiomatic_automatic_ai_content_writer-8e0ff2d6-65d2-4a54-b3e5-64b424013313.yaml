  description: 'The Aiomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer & Editor, GPT-3 & GPT-4,
    ChatGPT ChatBot & AI Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''aiomatic_image_editor_ajax_submit''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
    In order to exploit the vulnerability, there must be a value entered for the Stability.AI
    API key. The value can be arbitrary.
