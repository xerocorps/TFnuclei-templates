  description: "The Backup and Restore WordPress \u2013 Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.50. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_queue_manual_backup()\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger backups\
    \ via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
