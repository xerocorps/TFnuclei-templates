  description: Wordpress Quiz and Survey Master <7.0.1 allows users to delete arbitrary
    files such as wp-config.php file, which could effectively take a site offline
    and allow an attacker to reinstall with a WordPress instance under their control.
    This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question, which allowed unauthenticated deletions
    (even though it was only intended for a person to delete their own quiz-answer
    files).
  impact: 'This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized deletion of critical files,
    resulting in data loss or server compromise.
