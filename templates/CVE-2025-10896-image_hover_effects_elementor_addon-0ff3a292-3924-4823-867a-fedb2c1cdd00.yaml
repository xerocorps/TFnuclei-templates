  description: 'Multiple plugins for WordPress with the Jewel Theme Recommended Plugins
    Library are vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type via
    arbitrary plugin installation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2.3. This
    is due to missing capability checks on the ''*_recommended_upgrade_plugin'' function
    which allows arbitrary plugin URLs to be installed. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to upload arbitrary
    plugin packages to the affected site''s server via a crafted plugin URL, which
    may make remote code execution possible.
