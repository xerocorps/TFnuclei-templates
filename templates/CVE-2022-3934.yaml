  description: 'WordPress FlatPM plugin before 3.0.13 contains a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape certain parameters before
    outputting them back in pages, which can be exploited against high privilege users
    such as admin. An attacker can steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
    launch other attacks.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential
    data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the affected website.
