  description: 'The Ezoic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
    to stored cross-site scripting via several REST-API endpoints in versions up to,
    and including, 2.8.8 due to missing capability checks and insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated-level attackers
    to make settings changes in the plugin.  Because of protections lacking in the
    plugin settings, it will allow attackers to subsequently inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
