  description: "The Analytics Insights \u2013 Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 6.2. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied\
    \ via the 'state' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick\
    \ them into performing an action.\n"
