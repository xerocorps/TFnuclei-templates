  description: 'The kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.0 via the  `TH_PhpCode` pagebuilder
    widget. This is due to the theme not restricting access to the code editor widget
    for non-administrators. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.
