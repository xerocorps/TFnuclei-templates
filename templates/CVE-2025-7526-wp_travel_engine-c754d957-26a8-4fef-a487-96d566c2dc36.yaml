  description: "The WP Travel Engine \u2013 Tour Booking Plugin \u2013 Tour Operator\
    \ Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion (via\
    \ renaming) due to insufficient file path validation in the set_user_profile_image\
    \ function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.7. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which\
    \ can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such\
    \ as wp-config.php).\n"
