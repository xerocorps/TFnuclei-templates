  description: 'The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure
    Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 5.2.0.5. This is due
    to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass
    authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to change user passwords
    and potentially take over super-administrator accounts in multisite setup.
