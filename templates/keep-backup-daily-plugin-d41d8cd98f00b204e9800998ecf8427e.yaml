  description: 'The Keep Backup Daily plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via any URL parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.0.3
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link. This is not likely to be exploitable in modern browsers.
