  description: 'The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Exposure in versions up to, and including, 10.2.2 via the api_get_post_summary
    function due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be retrieved. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and
    above, to extract data from posts they may not be able to edit or read otherwise.
    This also affects password protected, private, or draft posts that they should
    not have access to.
