  description: 'The Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) Recount Earnings extension for WordPress,
    as used with EDD 1.8.x before 1.8.7, 1.9.x before 1.9.10, 2.0.x before 2.0.5,
    2.1.x before 2.1.11, 2.2.x before 2.2.9, and 2.3.x before 2.3.7, has XSS because
    add_query_arg is misused. The standalone extension was not patched and a patched
    version was instead integrated into EDD Core.
