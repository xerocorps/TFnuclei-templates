  description: 'The Extra Charges To Payment Gateway For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the add_form_fields() method,
    hooked to the admin_head action in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2.1 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthorized (subscriber-level) attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
