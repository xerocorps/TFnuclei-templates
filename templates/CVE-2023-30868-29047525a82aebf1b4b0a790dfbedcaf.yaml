  description: 'The CMS Tree Page View plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''post_type'' parameter in versions up to, and including,
    1.6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link. Note that this was partially patched in version 1.6.7 but
    some bypasses were possible until 1.6.8.
