  description: 'The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce plugin, in all versions starting
    at 1.0.8 up until 1.3.2, contains a vulnerability due to improper nonce verification
    in its settings reset functionality. The issue exists in the settings_init() function,
    which processes a reset action based on specific query parameters in the URL.
    The related delete_settings() function performs a faulty nonce validation check,
    making the reset operation insecure and susceptible to unauthorized access.
