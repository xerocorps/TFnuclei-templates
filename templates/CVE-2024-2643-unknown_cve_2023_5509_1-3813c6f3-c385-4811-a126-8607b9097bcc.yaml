  description: 'The Floating Notification Bar, Sticky Menu on Scroll, Announcement
    Banner, and Sticky Header for Any Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including,
    2.6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
