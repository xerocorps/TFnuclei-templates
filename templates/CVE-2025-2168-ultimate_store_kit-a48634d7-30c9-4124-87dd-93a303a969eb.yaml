  description: 'The Ultimate Store Kit Elementor Addons, Woocommerce Builder, EDD
    Builder, Elementor Store Builder, Product Grid, Product Table, Woocommerce Slider
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.4.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on the dismiss() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to set arbitrary user meta values to `1` which can be leveraged to lock and administrator
    out of their site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
