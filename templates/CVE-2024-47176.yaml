  description: 'CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and cups-browsed
    contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to, auto-discovering
    print services and shared printers. cups-browsed binds to INADDR_ANY-631, causing
    it to trust any packet from any source, and can cause the Get-Printer-Attributes
    IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.

    Due to the service binding to *-631 ( INADDR_ANY ), multiple bugs in cups-browsed
    can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious printer to the system. This
    chain of exploits ultimately enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands
    remotely on the target machine without authentication when a print job is started.
    This poses a significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability
    is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet, potentially
    exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their CUPS services are
    enabled.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
    on the target system.
