  description: 'The Football Pool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''answer'' parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.11.9
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
