  description: "The Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, Registration, Login, Member\
    \ Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to second-order SQL Injection via filenames in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.9.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of\
    \ sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with  access to upload files and manage filenames through\
    \ a third-party plugin like a File Manager, to append additional SQL queries into\
    \ already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from\
    \ the database. The risk of this vulnerability is very minimal as it requires\
    \ a user to be able to manipulate filenames in order to successfully exploit.\n"
