  description: 'The Bulk Delete plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization
    due to missing capability checks on several functions in versions before 5.5.4.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to perform restricted actions
    which could lead to the arbitrary deletion of site content including pages, posts
    and users.
