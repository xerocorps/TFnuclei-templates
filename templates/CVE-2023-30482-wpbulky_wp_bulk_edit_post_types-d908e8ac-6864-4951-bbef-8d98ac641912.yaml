  description: 'The WPBulky plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization
    via the ''sanitize'' function which does not sufficiently sanitize content that
    does not contain HTML tags, as well as insufficient output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
