  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''pmpro_courses_modules''
    setting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
    This can also be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery.
