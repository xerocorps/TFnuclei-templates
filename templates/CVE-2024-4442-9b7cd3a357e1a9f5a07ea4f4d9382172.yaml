  description: 'The Salon booking system plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 9.8. This is due to the plugin
    not properly validating the path of an uploaded file prior to deleting it. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including
    the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution
    possible.
