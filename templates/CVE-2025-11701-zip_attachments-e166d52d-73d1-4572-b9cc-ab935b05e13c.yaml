  description: 'The Zip Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access of data due to a missing capability check as well as missing post status
    validation in the za_create_zip_callback function in all versions up to, and including,
    1.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download attachments
    from private and password-protected posts.
