  description: "The WPFunnels \u2013 The Easiest Funnel Builder For WordPress And\
    \ WooCommerce To Collect Leads And Increase Sales plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to unauthorized user registration in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.2.\
    \ This is due to the plugin relying on a user controlled value 'optin_allow_registration'\
    \ to determine if user registration is allowed, instead of the site-specific setting.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register new user accounts,\
    \ even when user registration is disabled.\n"
