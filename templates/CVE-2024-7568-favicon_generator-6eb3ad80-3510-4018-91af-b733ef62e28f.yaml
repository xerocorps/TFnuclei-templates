    cvss-score: 9.6
  description: 'The Favicon Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the output_sub_admin_page_0 function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link. The plugin author deleted the functionality
    of the plugin to patch this issue and close the plugin, we recommend seeking an
    alternative to this plugin. CVE-2024-7864 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.
