  description: 'The Propovoice Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 1.7.0.3 due to insufficient escaping on the
    user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL
    query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
    information from the database.
