  description: 'The Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.34. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity or capability prior to
    updating their details like email in the ''Eventin\Speaker\Api\SpeakerController::update_item''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with contributor-level
    and above permissions to change arbitrary user''s email addresses, including administrators,
    and leverage that to reset the user''s password and gain access to their account.
