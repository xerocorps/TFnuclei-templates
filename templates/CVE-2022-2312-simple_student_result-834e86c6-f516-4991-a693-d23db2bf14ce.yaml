  description: 'The Student Result or Employee Database plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery on its ajax actions in versions up to, and including,
    1.7.4 due to improper or missing nonce verification. This allows unauthenticated
    attackers to utilize these ajax actions to add or delete students/employees provided
    they can trick a contributor or higher-privileged user into clicking on a link.
    Furthermore, due to insufficient input sanitization of user input, this weakness
    can be utilized for Stored Cross-Site Scripting.
