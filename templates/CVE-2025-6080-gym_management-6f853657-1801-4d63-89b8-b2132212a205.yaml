  description: 'The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to unauthorized admin account creation in all versions up to, and including,
    67.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s capabilities
    prior to adding users. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to create new users, including admins.
