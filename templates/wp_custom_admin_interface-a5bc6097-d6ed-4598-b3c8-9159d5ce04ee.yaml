  description: 'The WP Custom Admin Interface plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.32. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_custom_admin_interface_delete_transients
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete plugin
    transients via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
