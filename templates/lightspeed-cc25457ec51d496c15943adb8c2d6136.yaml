  description: The Lightspeed theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via VALUMS_UPLOADER_PATH/php.php in
    versions up to, and including 1.1.2. This makes it possible for attackers to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
