  description: 'Multiple plugins for WordPress by Trustindex.io are vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ~/tabs/feature_request.php
    file in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with editor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible. This vulnerability
    may only be fully exploitable for RCE in unique scenarios where the server is
    overloaded and the unlink() is not triggered immediately following move_uploaded_file().
