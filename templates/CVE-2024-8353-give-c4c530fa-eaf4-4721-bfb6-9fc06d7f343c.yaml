  description: "The GiveWP \u2013 Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 3.16.1 via deserialization of untrusted input via several parameters\
    \ like 'give_title' and 'card_address'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows\
    \ attackers to delete arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution. This\
    \ is essentially the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-5932, however, it was discovered\
    \ the the presence of stripslashes_deep on user_info allows the is_serialized\
    \ check to be bypassed. This issue was mostly patched in 3.16.1, but further hardening\
    \ was added in 3.16.2.\n"
