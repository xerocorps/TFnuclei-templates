  author: me
  description: This module integrates webforms with eloqua, an automated marketing
    and demand generation software built to improve the quality and quantity of customers
    sales leads and streamline their sales processes. In certain cases the module
    doesnt sufficiently sanitize data before passing it to PHPs unserialize() function,
    which could result in Remote Code Execution via PHP Object Injection. This vulnerability
    is mitigated by the fact that an attack must operate with the permission access
    administration pages, however this could be the case if this issue were combined
    with others in an attack chain.
