  description: 'The Opt-In Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the admin_upload() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.07. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible. Due
    to the presence of an .htaccess file, this can only be exploited to achieve RCE
    on NGINX servers, unless another vulnerability is present.
