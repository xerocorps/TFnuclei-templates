  description: The WP eBay Product Feeds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via its settings parameters in versions up to, and including,
    3.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
