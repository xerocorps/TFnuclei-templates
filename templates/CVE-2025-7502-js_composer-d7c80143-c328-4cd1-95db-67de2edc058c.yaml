  description: 'The WPBakery Page Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several shortcodes in all versions up to, and
    including, 8.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
    supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
