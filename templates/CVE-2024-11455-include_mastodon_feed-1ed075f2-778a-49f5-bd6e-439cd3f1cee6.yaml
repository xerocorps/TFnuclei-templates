  description: 'The Include Mastodon Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''include-mastodon-feed'' shortcode in
    all versions up to, and including, 1.9.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
