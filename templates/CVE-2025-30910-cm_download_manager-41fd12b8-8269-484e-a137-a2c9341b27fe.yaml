  description: "The CM Download Manager \u2013 Simplify file sharing with powerful\
    \ download management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion\
    \ due to insufficient file path validation in the deletescreenshot() function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to\
    \ remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
