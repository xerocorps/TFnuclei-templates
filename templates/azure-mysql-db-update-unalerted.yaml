  description: 'Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is fired whenever "Create/Update
    MySQL Database" events are triggered within your Microsoft Azure cloud account.
    The log alerts get triggered when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert configuration occurs. For this conformity rule, the matched
    condition is "Whenever the Activity Log has an event with Category=''Administrative'',
    Signal name=''Create/Update MySQL Database (servers/databases)''".

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Create or Update
    MySQL Database" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed, leading
    to potential security risks.

    "Create or Update MySQL Database" events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/databases/write"
