  description: 'The Increase Maximum Upload File Size | Increase Execution Time plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and
    including, 1.1.3. This is due to returning image upload error messages with full
    path information. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level
    permissions and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which
    can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its
    own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected
    website.
