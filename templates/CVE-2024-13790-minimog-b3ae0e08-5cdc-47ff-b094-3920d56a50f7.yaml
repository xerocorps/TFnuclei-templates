  description: "The MinimogWP \u2013 The High Converting eCommerce WordPress Theme\
    \ theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.7.0 via the 'template' parameter. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the\
    \ server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used\
    \ to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
