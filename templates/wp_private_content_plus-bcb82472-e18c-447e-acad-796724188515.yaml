  description: 'The WP Private Content Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Admin Settings in versions up to, and including,
    3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
