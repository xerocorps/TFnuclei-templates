  description: 'The NewsBoard Post and RSS Scroller plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.12. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
