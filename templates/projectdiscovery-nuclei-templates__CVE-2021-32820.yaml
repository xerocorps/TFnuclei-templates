  description: Express-handlebars is susceptible to local file inclusion because it
    mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express
    render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure
    vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat
    restricted in that only files with existing extensions (i.e., file.extension)
    can be included. Files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to
    them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-018 report. Notes
    in documentation have been added to help users avoid this potential information
    exposure vulnerability.
  impact: 'An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the
    server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or sensitive information disclosure.
