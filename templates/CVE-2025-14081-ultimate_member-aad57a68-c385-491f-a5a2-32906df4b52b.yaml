  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Profile
    Privacy Setting Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0. This is due
    to a flaw in the secure fields mechanism where field keys are stored in the allowed
    fields list before the `required_perm` check is applied during rendering. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access to
    modify their profile privacy settings (e.g., setting profile to "Only me") via
    direct parameter manipulation, even when the administrator has explicitly disabled
    the option for their role.
