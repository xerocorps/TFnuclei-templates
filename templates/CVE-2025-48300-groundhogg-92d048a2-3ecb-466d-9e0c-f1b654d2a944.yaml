  description: "The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award\
    \ Winner \u2014 Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file\
    \ uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 4.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with sales rep-level\
    \ access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which\
    \ may make remote code execution possible.\n"
