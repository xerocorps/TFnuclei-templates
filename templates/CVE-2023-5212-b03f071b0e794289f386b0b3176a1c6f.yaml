  description: 'The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Deletion in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 as well as version 4.9.2. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges to delete
    arbitrary files on the server, which makes it possible to take over affected sites
    as well as others sharing the same hosting account. Version 4.9.1 originally addressed
    the issue, but it was reintroduced in 4.9.2 and fixed again in 4.9.3.
