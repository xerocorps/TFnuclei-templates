  description: 'The Indeed Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation in all versions up to, and including, 12.7. This is due to the plugin
    not properly restricting access to functionality that allows privilege assignment.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain access to accounts
    that have higher privileges, such as administrator.
