  description: CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a type of security
    vulnerability that occurs when an attacker tricks a user's browser into making
    an unintended and potentially malicious request to a web application on which
    the user is authenticated. This can lead to actions being performed on behalf
    of the user without their consent. The aim dashboard lacks protection against
    CSRF and CORS attacks, hence allowing an attacker to trick an user into performing
    actions on their behalf such as deleting runs from the dashboard.
  name: CSRF and CORS vulnerability in AIM Dashboardv3.17.5
