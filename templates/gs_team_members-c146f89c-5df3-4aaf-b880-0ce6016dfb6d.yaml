    \ Carousel, Slider, Table, List, and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode(s) in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 2.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\
    \ on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers\
    \ with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts\
    \ in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
