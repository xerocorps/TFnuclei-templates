  description: 'The Booking calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    via the search functionality on multiple administrative pages in versions up to,
    and including, 3.2.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameters
    and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers with Editor privileges and above to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
    information from the database. Note that the Pro version of the plugin allows
    administrators to grant access to the plugin''s Administrative pages to any user
    role, so other roles may be able to exploit the vulnerability if they have been
    granted access.
