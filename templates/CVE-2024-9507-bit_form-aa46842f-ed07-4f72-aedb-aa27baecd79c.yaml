  description: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact
    Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.2
    due to improper input validation within the iconUpload function. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above,
    to leverage a PHP filter chain attack and read the contents of arbitrary files
    on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
