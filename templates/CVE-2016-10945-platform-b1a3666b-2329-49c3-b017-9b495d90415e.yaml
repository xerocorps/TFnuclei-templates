  description: 'The Platform 4 theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation in the ''includes/library.options.php'' file. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative
    actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
