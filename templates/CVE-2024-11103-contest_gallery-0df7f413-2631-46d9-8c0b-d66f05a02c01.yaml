  description: 'The Contest Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 24.0.7.
    This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to
    updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators, and leverage
    that to gain access to their account.
