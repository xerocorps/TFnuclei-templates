  description: 'The File (Field) Paths module extends the default functionality of
    Drupals core File module, by adding the ability to use entity-based tokens in
    destination paths and file names. The modules default configuration could temporarily
    expose private files to anonymous visitors. Important note:  to fix the problem,
    database updates must be run in addition to updating the module. Its possible
    to make a configuration change to mitigate this problem in the admin UI at /admin/config/media/file-system/filefield-paths
    - the temp file location should use either the temporary:// or private:// stream
    wrapper if uploaded files should not be exposed publicly. This vulnerability is
    mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be able to guess the temporary path
    used for file upload.'
