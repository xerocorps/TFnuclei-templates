  description: "The WP Discord Post Plus \u2013  Supports Unlimited Channels plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform\
    \ an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
