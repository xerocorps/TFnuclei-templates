  description: 'The Responsive WordPress Slider WordPress plugin through 2.2.0 does
    not sanitise and escape some of the Slider options, allowing Cross-Site Scripting
    payloads to be set in them. Furthermore, as by default any authenticated user
    is allowed to create Sliders (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slider-can-be-changed-from-any-user-even-subscriber/,
    such settings can be changed in the plugin''s settings), this would allow user
    with a role as low as subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against
    logged in admins viewing the slider list and could lead to privilege escalation
    by creating a rogue admin account for example.
