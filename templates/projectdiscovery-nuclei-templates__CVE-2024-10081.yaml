  description: 'Authentication bypass occurs when the API URL ends with Authentication,
    Configuration or ServerInfo. This bypass allows superuser access to all API endpoints
    other than Authentication. These endpoints include the ability to add, edit, and
    remove products, among others.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication by crafting API URLs
    ending with specific keywords, gaining superuser access to all API endpoints including
    product management and configuration.
