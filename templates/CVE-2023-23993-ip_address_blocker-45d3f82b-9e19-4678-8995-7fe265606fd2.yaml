  description: 'The IP Blocker Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 11.1.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the save_configuration, delete_ip, and add_ip_to_db
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable
    the "Display blank page to the Banned User" setting, delete blocked IPs from the
    IP blocklist, or add arbitrary IPs to the IP blocklist via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
