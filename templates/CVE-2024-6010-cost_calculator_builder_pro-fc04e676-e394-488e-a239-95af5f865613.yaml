  description: 'The Cost Calculator Builder PRO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1. This is due
    to the plugin allowing the price field to be manipulated prior to processing via
    the ''create_cc_order'' function, called from the Cost Calculator Builder plugin.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate the price of
    orders submitted via the calculator. Note: this vulnerability was partially patched
    with the release of Cost Calculator Builder version 3.2.17.
