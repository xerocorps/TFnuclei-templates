  description: 'The Appointment Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.92. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL queries via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
