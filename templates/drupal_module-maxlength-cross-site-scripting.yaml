info:
  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module enables you to set a maximum length allowed on text fields
    and indicate how many characters are left. The module doesnt sufficiently filter
    strings leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability
    is mitigated by the fact the malicious script will not be triggered in the browser
    of UID 1 nor any user with Bypass maxlength setting.
