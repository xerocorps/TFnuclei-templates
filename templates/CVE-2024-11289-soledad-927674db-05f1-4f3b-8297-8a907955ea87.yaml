    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The Soledad theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in all versions up to, and including, 8.5.9 via several functions like penci_archive_more_post_ajax_func,
    penci_more_post_ajax_func, and penci_more_featured_post_ajax_func. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute PHP files on
    the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be
    used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution
    in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included. The exploitability of this
    is limited to Windows.
