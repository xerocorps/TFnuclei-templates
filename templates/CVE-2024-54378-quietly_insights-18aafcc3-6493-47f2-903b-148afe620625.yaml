  description: 'The Quietly Insights plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability
    check on a function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
    to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update
    the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration
    for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
