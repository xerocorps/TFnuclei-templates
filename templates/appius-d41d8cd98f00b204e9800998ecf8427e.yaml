  description: The Appius theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the uploadify.php file in versions up to,
    and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
