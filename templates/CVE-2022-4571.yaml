  description: The Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via shortcode in versions up to, and including,
    2.19.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page.
