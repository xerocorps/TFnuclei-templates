  description: 'The BM Content Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to 3.16.3.3
    (exclusive). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
    access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead
    to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
