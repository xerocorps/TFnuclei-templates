  description: 'The WooCommerce Custom Registration Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the del_field and save_all_data
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit and delete
    registration forms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
