  description: 'Multiple themes for WordPress by Themify Themes are vulnerable to
    Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
