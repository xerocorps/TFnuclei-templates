  description: 'The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the fnsf_delete_posts function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
