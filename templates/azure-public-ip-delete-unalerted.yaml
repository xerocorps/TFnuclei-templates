  description: 'Ensure that activity log alerts are used to detect "Delete Public
    IP Address" events within your Microsoft Azure cloud account. An activity log
    alert gets activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert occurs.

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Delete Public IP
    Address" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed, leading
    to potential security risks.
