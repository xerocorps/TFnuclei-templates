  description: 'The Skip to Timestamp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''skipto'' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
    1.4.4. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the
    ''time'' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
