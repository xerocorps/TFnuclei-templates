  description: 'The Last Viewed Posts by WPBeginner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via deserialization
    of untrusted input from the LastViewedPosts Cookie. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
    in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or
    theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
    files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
