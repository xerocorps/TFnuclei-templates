  description: 'The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''Phone'', ''Dial Code'', ''Job Title'', ''Academic
    Level'', ''Age'', ''Salary'', ''Gender'', ''Industry'', ''Full Address'' fields
    via the candidate user profile found on the user dashboard in versions up to,
    and including, 1.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
