  description: 'The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    in versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to the ''verification_id''
    value being set to empty, and the not empty check is missing in the dashboard
    user profile page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log
    in to the first verified user.
