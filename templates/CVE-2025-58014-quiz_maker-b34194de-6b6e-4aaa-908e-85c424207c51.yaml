  description: 'The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.7.0.64. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
