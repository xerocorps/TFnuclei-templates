  description: "The Role Includer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018user_id\u2019 parameter in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
