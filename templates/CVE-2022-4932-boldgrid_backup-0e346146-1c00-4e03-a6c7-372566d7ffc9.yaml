  description: 'The Total Upkeep plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information
    disclosure in versions up to, and including 1.14.13. This is due to missing authorization
    on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
    and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download
    the back-up.
