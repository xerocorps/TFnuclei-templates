  description: The sintic_gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation via the uploadify.php file in
    all known versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
