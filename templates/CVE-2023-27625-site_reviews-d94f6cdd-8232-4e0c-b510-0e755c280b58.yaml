  description: 'The Site Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to setting modification
    and information disclosure due to lack of capability checks in a variety of functions,
    including rollbackPluginAjax, downloadConsole, downloadSystemInfo and exportSettings
    in versions up to, and including, 6.5.1. These functions are also vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access, and
    above, to tamper with the console logging level amongst other actions like rolling
    back the plugin''s version.
