  description: 'The AA Block Country plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address
    Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin trusting
    user-supplied headers such as HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to determine the client''s
    IP address without proper validation or considering if the server is behind a
    trusted proxy. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass
    IP-based access restrictions by spoofing their IP address via the X-Forwarded-For
    header.
