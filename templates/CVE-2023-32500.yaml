  description: The Woodmart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to modify the plugin's license via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
