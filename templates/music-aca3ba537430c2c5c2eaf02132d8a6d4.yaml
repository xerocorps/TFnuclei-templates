  description: The Music theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting,
    Content Spoofing, and Path Traversal in all known versions. This is due to inclusion
    of a vulnerable version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser,
    create fake content, and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which
    can contain sensitive information.
