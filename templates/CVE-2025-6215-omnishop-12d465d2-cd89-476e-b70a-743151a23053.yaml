  description: "The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated\
    \ Registration Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. Its /users/register\
    \ endpoint is exposed to the public (permission_callback always returns true)\
    \ and invokes wp_create_user() unconditionally,  ignoring the site\u2019s users_can_register\
    \ option and any nonce or CAPTCHA checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to create arbitrary user accounts (customer) on sites where registrations\
    \ should be closed.\n"
