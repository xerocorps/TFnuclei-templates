  description: 'The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address
    Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 8.5.02.005. This is due to insufficient
    restrictions on where the IP Address information is being retrieved for request
    logging and login restrictions. Attackers can supply a header that allows their
    IP address to appear from a different location.
