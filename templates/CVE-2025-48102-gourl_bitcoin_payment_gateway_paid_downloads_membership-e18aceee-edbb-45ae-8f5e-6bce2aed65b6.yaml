  description: 'The GoUrl Bitcoin Payment Gateway &amp; Paid Downloads &amp; Membership
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions
    up to, and including, 1.6.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
