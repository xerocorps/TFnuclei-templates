  description: 'The Download Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation and access controls on the ''upload_file''
    function in versions up to, and including, 4.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
