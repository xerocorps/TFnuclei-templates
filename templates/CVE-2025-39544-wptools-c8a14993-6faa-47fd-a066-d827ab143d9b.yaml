  description: 'The WP Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.18. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the deactivate_mu_plugin() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to rename arbitrary files (which is the equivalent
    of arbitrary file deletion) via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
