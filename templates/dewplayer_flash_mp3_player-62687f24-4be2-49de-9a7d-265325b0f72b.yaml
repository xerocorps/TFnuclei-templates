  description: 'The Dewplayer plugin <= 1.2 and Advanced Dewplayer plugin < 1.5 for
    WordPress are vulnerable to Content Spoofing/Injection. This is due to lack of
    sanitization of the ''mp3'', ''file'', ''sound'', and ''son'' parameters in the
    dewplayer.swf file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    malicious content into legitimate content if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
