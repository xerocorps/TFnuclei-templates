  description: 'The Real Estate 7 premium theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack vector in versions up to, and including, v3.3.4
    via the ''ct_additional_features'' option due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject
    malicious JavaScript payload in the search page that execute if they can trick
    a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
