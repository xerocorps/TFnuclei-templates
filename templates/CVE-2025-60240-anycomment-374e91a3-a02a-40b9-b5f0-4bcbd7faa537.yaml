  description: 'The AnyComment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to, and including, 0.3.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution
    of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
    sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe"
    file types can be uploaded and included.
