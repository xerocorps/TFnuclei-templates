  description: 'The WP Docs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection
    via the ''dir_id'' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0 due to
    insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation
    on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
    already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from
    the database. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.2.0.
