  description: 'The WP Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.11. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the wpatt_plugin_options function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
