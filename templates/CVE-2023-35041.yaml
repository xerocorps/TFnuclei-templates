  description: 'The Webpushr plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.34.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation within the wpp_save_settings function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to conduct local file inclusion attacks by leveraging
    the ''menu'' parameter via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
