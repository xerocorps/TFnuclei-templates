  description: 'The WP Easycart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''wp-easycart-submit-newsletter'' function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unknown action granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
