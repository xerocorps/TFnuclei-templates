  description: 'The CYAN Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ''delete'' functionality
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files
    on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file
    is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
