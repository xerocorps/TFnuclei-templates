  description: 'The Beaver Builder Plugin (Starter Version) plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    ''save_enabled_icons'' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.1. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
    and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability was partially patched in
    version 2.9.1.
