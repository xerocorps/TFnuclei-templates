    cvss-score: 7.5
  description: 'The Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.17.5
    via deserialization of untrusted input from the vulnerable ''id'' parameter in
    the ''auxin_template_control_importer'' function. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers able to upload a separate PHAR payload as an image file to inject a
    PHP Object, though the action itself is available to subscribers. No POP chain
    is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
    delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
