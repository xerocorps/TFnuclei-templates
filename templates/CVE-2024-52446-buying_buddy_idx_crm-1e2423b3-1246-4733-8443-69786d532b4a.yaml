  description: 'The Buying Buddy IDX CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject an object and execute magic methods in
    cases where a POP chain is present via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
