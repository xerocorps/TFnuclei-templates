  description: 'The Contact Form, Survey, Quiz & Popup Form Builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including,
    1.7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
