  description: The Rename Admin Path module provides additional security to Drupal
    sites by renaming the admin paths. The module has a vulnerability with allows
    attackers to bypass the protection by using specially crafted URLs. The risk is
    mitigated by the fact that, even though the attacker can bypass the protection
    offered by this module, all regular permissions still apply.
