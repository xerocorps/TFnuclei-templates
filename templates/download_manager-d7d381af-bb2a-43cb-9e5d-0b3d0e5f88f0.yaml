  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the savePackage() function in versions
    up to, and including, 2.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to associate arbitrary files with posts and subsequently download those files
    causing sensitive information disclosure.
