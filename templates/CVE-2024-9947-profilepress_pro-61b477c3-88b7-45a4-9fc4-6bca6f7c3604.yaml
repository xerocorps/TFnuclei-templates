  description: 'The ProfilePress Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.11.1. This is due to insufficient
    verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the
    site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user
    does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.
