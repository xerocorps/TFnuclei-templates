  description: 'The Demo Importer Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to insufficient
    file type validation detecting WXR files, allowing double extension files to bypass
    sanitization while being accepted as a valid WXR file. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
