  description: 'The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file moving due to insufficient file path
    validation via the wc-upload-file[] parameter in all versions up to, and including,
    1.1.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is moved (such as wp-config.php).
