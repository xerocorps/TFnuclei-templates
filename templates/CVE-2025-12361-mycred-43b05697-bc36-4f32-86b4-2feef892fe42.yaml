  description: "The myCred \u2013 Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks,\
    \ Badges, and Loyalty Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 2.9.7.1. This is due to the plugin not properly\
    \ verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve\
    \ sensitive information including user IDs, display names, and email addresses\
    \ of all users on the site via the get_bank_accounts AJAX action. Passwords are\
    \ not exposed.\n"
