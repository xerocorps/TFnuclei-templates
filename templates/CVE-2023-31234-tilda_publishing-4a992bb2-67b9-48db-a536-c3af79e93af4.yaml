    cvss-score: 5.4
  description: 'The Tilda Publishing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access, modification, and loss of data due to missing capability checks on several
    functions hooked via AJAX actions such as ''ajax_export_file,'' ''ajax_sync,''
    ''ajax_get_keys,'' ''ajax_switcher_status,'' and more in versions up to, and including,
    0.3.23. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    access and above, to perform a wide variety of actions like exporting data, modifying
    keys, and more.
