  description: "The Chartify \u2013 WordPress Chart Plugin plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.5\
    \ via the 'source' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
