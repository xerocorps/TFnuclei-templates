  description: "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only\
    \ by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks\
    \ Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.\n"
