  description: 'The Majestic Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
    Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and
    execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code
    in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data,
    or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe" file types can
    be uploaded and included.
