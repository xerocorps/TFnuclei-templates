  description: 'The Like dislike plus counter | Like Dislike Buttons plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
