  description: "The Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form\
    \ Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.44.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'entry_delete_upload_files'\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP\
    \ Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable\
    \ software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin\
    \ or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is\
    \ present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it\
    \ may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. Deserialization\
    \ occurs when the form submission is deleted, whether by an Administrator or via\
    \ auto-deletion determined by plugin settings.\n"
