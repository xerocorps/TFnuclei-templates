  description: "The HTML filter and csv-file search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.7 via the 'src'\
    \ attribute of the 'csvsearch' shortcode. This allows authenticated attackers,\
    \ with contributor-level permissions and above, to include and execute arbitrary\
    \ files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included.\n"
