  description: 'The Uploadify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''process_upload.php'' file
    in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
