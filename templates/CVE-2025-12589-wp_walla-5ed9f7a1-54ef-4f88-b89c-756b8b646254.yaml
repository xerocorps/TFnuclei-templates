  description: 'The WP-Walla plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 0.5.3.5.
    This is due to missing nonce verification on the settings page and insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via a forged request granted
    they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
    a link.
