  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.11.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Editor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which
    can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such
    as wp-config.php).
