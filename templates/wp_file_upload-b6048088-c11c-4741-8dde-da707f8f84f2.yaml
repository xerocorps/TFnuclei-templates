  description: 'The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the wfu_ajax_action_save_shortcode function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save shortcodes via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or editor into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
