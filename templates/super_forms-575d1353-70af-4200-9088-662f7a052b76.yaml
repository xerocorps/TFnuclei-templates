  description: "The Super Forms \u2013 Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation\
    \ in the super-forms/uploads/php/directory in versions up to, and including, 4.9.702.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files\
    \ on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
