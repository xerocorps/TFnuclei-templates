  description: 'The Category Posts Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including,
    4.9.19 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
