  description: 'The User Registration, User Profile, Login & Membership &#8211; ProfilePress
    (Formerly WP User Avatar) WordPress plugin before 3.1.11''s widget for tabbed
    login/register was not properly escaped and could be used in an XSS attack which
    could lead to wp-admin access. Further, the plugin in several places assigned
    $_POST as $_GET which meant that in some cases this could be replicated with just
    $_GET parameters and no need for $_POST values.
