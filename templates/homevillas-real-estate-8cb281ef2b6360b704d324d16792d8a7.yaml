  description: The Home Villas | Real Estate WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to both Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions
    up to, and including, 2.2 (11 March 2020) due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The vulnerabilities were
    patched in version 2.2 (1 September 20).
