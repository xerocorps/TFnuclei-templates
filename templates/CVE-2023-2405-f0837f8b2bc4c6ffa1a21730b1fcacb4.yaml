  description: 'The CRM and Lead Management by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This is
    due to missing nonce validation in the vcita-callback.php file. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings and inject
    malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
