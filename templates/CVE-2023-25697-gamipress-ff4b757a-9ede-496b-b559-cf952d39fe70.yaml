  description: 'The GamiPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the bulk_delete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to invoke this function via forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link and results
    in the bulk deletion of user earnings.
