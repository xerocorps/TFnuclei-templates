  description: 'The Top Store theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary
    plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the top_store_install_and_activate_callback()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary
    plugins which can contain other exploitable vulnerabilities to elevate privileges
    and gain remote code execution.
