  description: "The HUSKY \u2013 Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.3.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on\
    \ the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
