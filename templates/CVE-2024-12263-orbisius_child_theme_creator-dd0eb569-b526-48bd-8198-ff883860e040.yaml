  description: 'The Child Theme Creator by Orbisius plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the
    cloud_delete() and cloud_update() functions in all versions up to, and including,
    1.5.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to update and delete cloud snippets. Please note that this vulnerability
    was present in the Cloud Library Addon used by the plugin and not in the plugin
    itself, the cloud library has been removed entirely.
