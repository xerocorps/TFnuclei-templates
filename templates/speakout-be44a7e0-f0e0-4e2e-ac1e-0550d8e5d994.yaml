    \ Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018searchString\u2019 parameter in\
    \ versions up to, and including, 2.13.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
