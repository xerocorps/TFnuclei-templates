  description: 'The Weave server API allows remote users to fetch files from a specific
    directory, but due to a lack of input validation, it is possible to traverse and
    leak arbitrary files remotely. In various common scenarios, this allows a low-privileged
    user to assume the role of the server admin.

    '
  impact: 'Authenticated low-privileged attackers can exploit path traversal to read
    arbitrary files from the server, potentially accessing sensitive configuration
    files and credentials to escalate privileges to admin level.
