  description: "The WP ULike \u2013 Most Advanced Marketing Toolkit plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings (button image)\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only\
    \ affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has\
    \ been disabled.\n"
