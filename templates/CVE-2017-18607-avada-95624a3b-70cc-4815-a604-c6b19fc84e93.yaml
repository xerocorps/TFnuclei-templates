  description: 'The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.4. This is due to missing nonce
    validation on the fusion_builder_importer() function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to trigger the importer and upload arbitrary files via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
