  description: 'The Taxi Booking Manager for Woocommerce | E-cab plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a
    user''s capabilities prior to updating a plugin setting or their identity prior
    to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to change arbitrary user''s email addresses, including administrators,
    and leverage that to reset the user''s password and gain access to their account.
    CVE-2025-54713 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
