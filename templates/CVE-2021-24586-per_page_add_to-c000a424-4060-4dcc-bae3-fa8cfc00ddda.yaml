  description: 'The Per page add to head WordPress plugin before 1.4.4 is lacking
    any CSRF check when saving its settings, which could allow attackers to make a
    logged in admin change them. Furthermore, as the plugin allows arbitrary HTML
    to be inserted in one of the setting (feature mentioned by the plugin), this could
    lead to Stored XSS issue which will be triggered either in the backend, frontend
    or both depending on the payload used.
