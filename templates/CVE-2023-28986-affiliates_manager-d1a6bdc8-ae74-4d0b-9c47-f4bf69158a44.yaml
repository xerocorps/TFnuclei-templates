  description: 'The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.20. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the process_bulk_action() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk modifications of commissions and
    clicks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
