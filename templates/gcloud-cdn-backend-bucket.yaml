  description: 'Ensure that the Cloud CDN origin associated with your Google Cloud
    load balancer points to a backend bucket instead of a backend service in order
    to provide enhanced performance, cost savings, simplified management, and the
    ability to customize caching rules.

  impact: 'Using a backend service as the Cloud CDN origin instead of a backend bucket
    may lead to increased costs, complex management, and suboptimal caching configurations,
    impacting performance and operational efficiency.
