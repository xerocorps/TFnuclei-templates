  description: 'The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Scripting by using the ''mf_last_name'' shortcode to echo unescaped
    form submissions in versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This allows authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level permissions or above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute when the victim visits a a page containing
    the shortcode when the submission id is present in the query string. Note that
    getting the JavaScript to execute requires user interaction as the victim must
    visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored in
    the site database.
