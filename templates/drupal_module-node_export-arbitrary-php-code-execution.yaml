info:
  author: me
  description: This module allows users to export nodes and then import it into another
    Drupal installation, or on the same site. In certain cases the module doesnt sufficiently
    sanitize data before passing it to PHPs unserialize() function, which could results
    in Remote Code Execution via PHP Object Injection. This vulnerability is mitigated
    by the fact that an attack must operate with the permission Use PHP to import
    nodes, however this could be the case if this issue were combined with others
    in an attack chain. In general, if this module is not in active use it is recommended
    to disable it.
