  description: 'The The XStore theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode
    execution in all versions up to, and including, 9.5.3. This is due to the software
    allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before
    running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    execute arbitrary shortcodes.
