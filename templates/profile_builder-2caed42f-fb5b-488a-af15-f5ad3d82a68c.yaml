  description: 'The Profile Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.4.0.  This makes it possible for
    subscriber-level attackers to elevate user roles to administrative levels, giving
    them full control of the website.  This vulnerability only impacts websites that
    have registration enabled, but given that the plugin functionality is directly
    related to registration it is likely that the majority of websites with the plugin
    installed are effected.
