  description: 'The Product Carousel Slider & Grid Ultimate for WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.10.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
