  description: "The WP Umbrella: Update Backup Restore & Monitoring plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.17.0 via the 'filename' parameter of the 'umbrella-restore' action. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
