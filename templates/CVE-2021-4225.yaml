  description: The SP Project & Document Manager WordPress plugin before 4.24 allows
    any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to upload files. The plugin attempts
    to prevent PHP and other similar files that could be executed on the server from
    being uploaded by checking the file extension. It was discovered that on Windows
    servers, the security checks in place were insufficient, enabling bad actors to
    potentially upload backdoors on vulnerable sites.
