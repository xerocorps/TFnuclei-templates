  description: 'The wpbakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Post Title tag attribute in all versions up to, and including,
    7.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
