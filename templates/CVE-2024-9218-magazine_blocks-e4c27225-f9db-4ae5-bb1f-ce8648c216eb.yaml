    \ Builder, Page Builder with Posts Blocks, Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate\
    \ escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.14. This makes\

    \ pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an\
    \ action such as clicking on a link.\n"
