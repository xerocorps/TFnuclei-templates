  description: 'The PopularFX theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the popularfx_getting_started_notice() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
