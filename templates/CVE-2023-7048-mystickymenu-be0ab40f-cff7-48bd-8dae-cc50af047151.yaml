    cvss-score: 3.1
  description: 'The My Sticky Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in mystickymenu-contact-leads.php. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the export of a CSV file containing
    contact leads via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Because the CSV file is
    exported to a public location, it can be downloaded during a very short window
    of time before it is automatically deleted by the export function.
