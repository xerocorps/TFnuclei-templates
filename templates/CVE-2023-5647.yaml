  description: 'The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Deletion in version 4.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
    with subscriber privileges to delete arbitrary files on the server, which makes
    it possible to take over affected sites as well as others sharing the same hosting
    account. This vulnerability is the same as CVE-2023-5212 but was accidentally
    reintroduced in version 4.9.2.
