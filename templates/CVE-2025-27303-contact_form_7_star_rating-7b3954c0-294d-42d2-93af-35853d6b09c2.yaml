  description: 'The Contact Form 7 Star Rating plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including,
    1.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
