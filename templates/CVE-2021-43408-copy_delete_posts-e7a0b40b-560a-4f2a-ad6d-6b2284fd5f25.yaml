  description: 'The "Duplicate Post" WordPress plugin up to and including version
    1.1.9 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when
    client supplied data is included within an SQL Query insecurely. SQL Injection
    can typically be exploited to read, modify and delete SQL table data. In many
    cases it also possible to exploit features of SQL server to execute system commands
    and/or access the local file system. This particular vulnerability can be exploited
    by any authenticated user who has been granted access to use the Duplicate Post
    plugin. By default, this is limited to Administrators, however the plugin presents
    the option to permit access to the Editor, Author, Contributor and Subscriber
    roles.
