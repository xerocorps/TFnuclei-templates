  description: 'The Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.22.20.
    This is due to wptc_decode_auth_token() function using a loose comparison. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and access
    user accounts, including those that may have administrative access. This vulnerability
    does require a site to have a connection to wptimecapsule.com in order to be exploited.
