  description: 'The JSON REST API plugin for WordPress is possibly vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1 due to a potential SOP bypass.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to conduct JSON Flash attacks via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
