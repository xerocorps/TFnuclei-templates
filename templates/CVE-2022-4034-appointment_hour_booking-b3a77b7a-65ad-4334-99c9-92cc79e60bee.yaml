  description: 'The Appointment Hour Booking Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.3.72. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into content during booking
    creation that may be exported as a CSV file when a site''s administrator exports
    booking details. This can result in code execution when these files are downloaded
    and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
