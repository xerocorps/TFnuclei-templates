  description: 'University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open()
    in PHP and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the imap_rimap
    function in c-client/imap4r1.c and the tcp_aopen function in osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c)
    without preventing argument injection, which might allow remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary OS commands if the IMAP server name is untrusted input (e.g., entered
    by a user of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced by a program with
    different argument semantics. For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on
    Debian and Ubuntu systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing
    a "-oProxyCommand" argument.

    '
  impact: 'Attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands through malicious IMAP server
    names when using imap_open() in PHP, potentially achieving remote code execution
    on servers where rsh is linked to ssh.
