  description: The Jetpack plugin for WordPress, in versions up to 3.5.2, is vulnerable
    to DOM based Cross-Site Scripting via the file genericons/example.html. This vulnerability
    allowed unauthenticated users to execute JavaScript in a visitor's browser provided
    they were able to trick them into clicking on a carefully crafted link. Executing
    JavaScript in an administrative user was possible if the victim was logged on
    to the affected site as an administrator.
