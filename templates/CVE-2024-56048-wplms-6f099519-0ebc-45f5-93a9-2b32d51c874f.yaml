  description: 'The WPLMS Learning Management System for WordPress, WordPress LMS
    theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can
    lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.9.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
    site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator
    and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
    to a vulnerable site.
