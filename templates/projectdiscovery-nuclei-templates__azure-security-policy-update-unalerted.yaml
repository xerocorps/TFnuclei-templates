  description: 'Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is used to detect "Update
    Security Policy" events within your Microsoft Azure cloud account. Activity log
    alerts get activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert occurs. In this case, the required alert condition is ''Whenever
    the Security Activity Log "Update security policy (Microsoft.Security/policies)"
    has "any" level, with "any" status and event is initiated by "any"''.

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Update Security Policy"
    events, unauthorized or unanticipated policy changes might go unnoticed, leading
    to potential security risks.

    "Update Security Policy" events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.Security/policies/write"
