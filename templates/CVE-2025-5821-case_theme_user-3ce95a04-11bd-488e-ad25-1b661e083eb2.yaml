  description: 'The Case Theme User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin
    not properly logging in a user with the data that was previously verified through
    the facebook_ajax_login_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to log in as administrative users, as long as they have an existing
    account on the site which can easily be created by default through the temp user
    functionality, and access to the administrative user''s email.
