  description: 'The Glass WordPress plugin through 1.3.2 does not sanitise or escape
    its "Glass Pages" setting before outputting in a page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting issue. Furthermore, the plugin did not have CSRF check in place when
    saving its settings, allowing the issue to be exploited via a CSRF attack.
