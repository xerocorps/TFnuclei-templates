  description: Wavlink products are affected by a vulnerability that may allow remote
    unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands as root on Wavlink devices.
    The user input is not properly sanitized which allows command injection via the
    "key" parameter in a login request. It has been tested on Wavlink WN575A4 and
    WN579X3 devices, but other products may also be affected.
