  description: 'The Inline Image Upload for BBPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file extension validation in the file
    uploading functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.19. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote
    code execution possible. This may be exploitable by unauthenticated attackers
    when the "Allow guest users without accounts to create topics and replies" setting
    is enabled.
