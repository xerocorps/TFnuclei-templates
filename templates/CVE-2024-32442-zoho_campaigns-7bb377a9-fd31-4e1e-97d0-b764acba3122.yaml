  description: 'The Zoho Campaigns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the zcwc_integration_disconnect() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the integration
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
