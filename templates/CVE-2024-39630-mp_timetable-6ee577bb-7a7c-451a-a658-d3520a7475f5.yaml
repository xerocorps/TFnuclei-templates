  description: 'The Timetable and Event Schedule by MotoPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.13
    via deserialization of untrusted input from comment meta data. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject
    a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
    chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
    it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data,
    or execute code.
