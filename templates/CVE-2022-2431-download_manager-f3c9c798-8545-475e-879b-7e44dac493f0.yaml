  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion in versions up to, and including 3.2.50. This is due to insufficient
    file type and path validation on the deleteFiles() function found in the ~/Admin/Menu/Packages.php
    file that triggers upon download post deletion. This makes it possible for contributor
    level users and above to supply an arbitrary file path via the ''file[files]''
    parameter when creating a download post and once the user deletes the post the
    supplied arbitrary file will be deleted. This can be used by attackers to delete
    the /wp-config.php file which will reset the installation and make it possible
    for an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server.
