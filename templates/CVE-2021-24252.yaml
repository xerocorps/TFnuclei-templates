  description: The Event Banner WordPress plugin through 1.3 does not verify the uploaded
    image file, allowing admin accounts to upload arbitrary files, such as .exe, .php,
    or others executable, leading to RCE. Due to the lack of CSRF check, the issue
    can also be used via such vector to achieve the same result, or via a LFI as authorisation
    checks are missing (but would require WP to be loaded)
