  description: The Resize Image After Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.5 due to insufficient
    nonce validation in the jr_uploadresize_options() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
