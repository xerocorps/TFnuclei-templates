  description: An arbitrary password reset issue was discovered in the Ultimate Member
    plugin 2.0.39 for WordPress. It is possible (due to lack of verification and correlation
    between the reset password key sent by mail and the user_id parameter) to reset
    the password of another user. One only needs to know the user_id, which is publicly
    available. One just has to intercept the password modification request and modify
    user_id. It is possible to modify the passwords for any users or admin WordPress
    Ultimate Members. This could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation.
