  description: 'The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the rest_simpleFileUpload() function
    in versions 2.9.3 and 2.9.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server when the REST API is enabled, which may make remote code execution
    possible.
