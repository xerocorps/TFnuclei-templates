  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    via the cookie in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.21 due to insufficient
    escaping on the user supplied value and lack of sufficient preparation on the
    existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level
    access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries
    that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
