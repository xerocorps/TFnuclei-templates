  description: 'The WordPress Books Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.4.8. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''wbg-api-import.php'' file and
    the functions ''wbg_gallery_settings'', ''wbg_search_panel_settings'', and ''wbg_details_settings''.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
