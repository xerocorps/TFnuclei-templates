  description: "The File Manager Pro \u2013 Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient permission controls on file uploads\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with administrative-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files\
    \ on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.\
    \ This may only be an issue on multi-site installations where users shouldn't\
    \ have access to upload files.\n"
