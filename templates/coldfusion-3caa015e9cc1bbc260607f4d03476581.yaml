  description: The ColdFusion Responsive Fullscreen Video Image Audio Theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via
    the upload_settings_image.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.1. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
