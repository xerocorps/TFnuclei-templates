  description: 'Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
    Threat Defense (FTD) Software are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and could
    allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct attacks against a user of
    the web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due
    to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface
    of an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading
    a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow
    the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface
    or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These
    vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For
    more information, see the reference links.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary script code in the context of a targeted user''s browser, potentially
    leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.
