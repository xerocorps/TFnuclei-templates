  description: 'The Kleo theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to 5.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on
    the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be
    used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution
    in cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and included.
