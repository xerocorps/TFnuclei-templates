  description: 'The WP Photo Effects plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''wppe_effect'' shortcode in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
