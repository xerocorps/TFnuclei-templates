  description: 'The WPC Shop as a Customer for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to account takeover and privilege escalation in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.2.8. This is due to the ''generate_key'' function not producing
    a sufficiently random value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to log in as site administrators, granted
    they have triggered the ajax_login() function which generates a unique key that
    can be used to log in.
