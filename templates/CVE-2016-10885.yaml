  description: The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to 1.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on the save_settings() function, in addition to a few other functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and
    upload files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
