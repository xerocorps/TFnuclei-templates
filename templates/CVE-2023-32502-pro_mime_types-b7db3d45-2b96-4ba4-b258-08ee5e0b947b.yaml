  description: 'The Pro Mime Types plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the pmt_settings_section_callback_tab_1() function used to
    control the plugin''s settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to enable and disable MIME-type support via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
