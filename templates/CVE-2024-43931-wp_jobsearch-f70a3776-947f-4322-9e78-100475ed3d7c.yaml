  description: 'The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
    Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3 via deserialization
    of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
    chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
    it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data,
    or execute code.
