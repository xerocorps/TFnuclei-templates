  description: 'The WOLF plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to invoke these functions via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This
    could lead to posts being reverted to earlier versions, deletion of earlier revisions
    or bulk deletion thereof.
