  description: 'The User Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.9.12 via deserialization of untrusted
    input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the
    vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme
    installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
    files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
