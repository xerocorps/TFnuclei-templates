  description: 'TheWP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.31.2 via deserialization of user-controlled
    input allowing a phar wrapper. This allows attackers to inject a PHP Object. No
    known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present
    via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow
    the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
