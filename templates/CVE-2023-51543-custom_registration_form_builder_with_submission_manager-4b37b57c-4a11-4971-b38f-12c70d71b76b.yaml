  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration,\
    \ Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5.0 due to use of user-supplied HTTP\
    \ headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to submit more form entries than the form submission limit allows.\n"
