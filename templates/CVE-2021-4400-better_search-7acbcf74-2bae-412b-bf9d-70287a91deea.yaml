  description: 'The Better Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the bsearch_process_settings_import() and bsearch_process_settings_export()
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to import and
    export settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
