  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to upload files via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
    Since uploaded files were not verified properly, this could lead to arbitrary
    file upload.
