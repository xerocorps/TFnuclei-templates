  description: 'The Featured Image Caption plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcode and post meta in all versions
    up to, and including, 0.8.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
