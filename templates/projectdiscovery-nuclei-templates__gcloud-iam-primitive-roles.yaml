  description: "For production and security-critical cloud environments, limit the\
    \ use of primitive roles such as \"Owner\", \"Editor\", and \"Viewer\" for Cloud\
    \ IAM members. Instead, grant predefined roles to these IAM members to allow the\
    \ least-permissive access required to perform their tasks (i.e., Principle of\
    \ Least Privilege \u2013 POLP).\n"
  impact: 'Using primitive roles can lead to overly broad access and potential security
    vulnerabilities, as these roles can grant extensive permissions across a wide
    range of resources.

    '
  name: Minimize the Use of Primitive Roles
  reference:
  - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles
  remediation: 'Replace primitive roles with predefined or custom roles tailored to
    the specific needs of the users and the minimum permissions they require to perform
    their tasks.
