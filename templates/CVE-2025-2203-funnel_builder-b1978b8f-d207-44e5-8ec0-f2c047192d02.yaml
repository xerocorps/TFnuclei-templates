  description: "The FunnelKit \u2013 Funnel Builder for WooCommerce Checkout plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 3.10.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack\
    \ of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append\
    \ additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract\
    \ sensitive information from the database.\n"
