  description: "The The Design for Contact Form 7 Style WordPress Plugin \u2013 CF7\
    \ WOW Styler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This is due to the software allowing\
    \ users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running\
    \ do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute\
    \ arbitrary shortcodes. This functionality is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting. Version 1.7.0 patched the Reflected XSS issue, however, the arbitrary\
    \ shortcode execution issue remains.\n"
