  description: 'ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide
    error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added
    to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on
    a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment. In some cases,
    the logs expose ASPXAUTH cookies allowing to hijack a logged in administrator
    session.
