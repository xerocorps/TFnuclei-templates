  description: 'The i-transform theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
