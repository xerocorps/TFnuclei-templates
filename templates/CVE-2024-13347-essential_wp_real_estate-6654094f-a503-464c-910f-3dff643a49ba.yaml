  description: 'The Essential WP Real Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of URLs without appropriate escaping
    on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
