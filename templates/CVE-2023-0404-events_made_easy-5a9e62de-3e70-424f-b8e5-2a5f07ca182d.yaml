  description: 'The Events Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions related to AJAX
    actions in versions up to, and including, 2.3.16. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those functions
    intended for administrator use. While the plugin is still pending review from
    the WordPress repository, site owners can download a copy of the patched version
    directly from the developer''s Github at https://github.com/liedekef/events-made-easy
