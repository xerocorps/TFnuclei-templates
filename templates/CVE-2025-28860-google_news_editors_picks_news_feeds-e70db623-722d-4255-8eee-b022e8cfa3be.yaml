  description: 'The Google News Editors Picks Feed Generator plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject
    malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
