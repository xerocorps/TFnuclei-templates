  description: 'The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files
    through the ''lang'' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4,
    and fully patched in 7.2.5.
