  description: "The Form Maker by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact\
    \ Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.26 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
