  description: "The FW Food Menu \u2013 Responsive food menu with ordering & delivery\
    \ solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due\
    \ to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.0.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right\
    \ file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
