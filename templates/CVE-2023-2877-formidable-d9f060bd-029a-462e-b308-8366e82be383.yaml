    cvss-score: 6.5
  description: 'The Formidable Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    arbitrary plugin installation and activation due to a missing capability check
    on the screen_page() and can_install_addon_api() functions in versions up to,
    and including, 6.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal
    permissions such as subscribers to  retrieve a valid token from the welcome page,
    and then subsequently install and activate arbitrary plugins onto the site utilizing
    that key. This can easily be leveraged by attackers to achieve remote code execution
    as they simply need to install another plugin with a vulnerability or functionality
    that will aid in further exploitation.
