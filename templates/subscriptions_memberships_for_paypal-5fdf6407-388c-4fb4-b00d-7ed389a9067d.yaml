  description: "The Subscriptions & Memberships for PayPal plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018page\u2019 parameter\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\nSeveral\
    \ additional security fixes were made up to version 1.1.6.\n"
