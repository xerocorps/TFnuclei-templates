    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The BWL Advanced FAQ Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to
    a missing capability check on the ''baf_set_notice_status'' AJAX action in all
    versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to
    ''1'' on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would
    create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to
    set some values to true such as registration.
