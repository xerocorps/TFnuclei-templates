  description: 'The Subscriptions & Memberships for PayPal plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
