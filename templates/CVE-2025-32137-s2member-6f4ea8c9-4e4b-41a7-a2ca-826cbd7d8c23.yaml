  description: "The s2Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 250419 via the 'ws_plugin__s2member_log_file'\
    \ parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing\
    \ the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
