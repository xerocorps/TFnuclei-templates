  description: 'The Responsive Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 1.7.6 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping and missing nonce validation. This makes
    it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s
    browser, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
