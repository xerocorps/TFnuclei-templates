  description: 'The Blanka - One Page WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Local File Inclusion in versions up to 1.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution
    of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
    sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe"
    file types can be uploaded and included.
