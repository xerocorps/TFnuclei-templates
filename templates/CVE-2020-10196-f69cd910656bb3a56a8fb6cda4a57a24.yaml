  description: 'An XSS vulnerability in the popup-builder plugin before 3.64.1 for
    WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into existing
    popups via an unsecured ajax action in com/classes/Ajax.php. It is possible for
    an unauthenticated attacker to insert malicious JavaScript in several of the popup''s
    fields by sending a request to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the POST action parameter
    of sgpb_autosave and including additional data in an allPopupData parameter, including
    the popup''s ID (which is visible in the source of the page in which the popup
    is inserted) and arbitrary JavaScript which will then be executed in the browsers
    of visitors to that page. Because the plugin functionality automatically adds
    script tags to data entered into these fields, this injection will typically bypass
    most WAF applications.
