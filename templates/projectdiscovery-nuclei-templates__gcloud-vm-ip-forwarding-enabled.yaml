  description: 'Ensure that IP Forwarding feature is not enabled at the Google Compute
    Engine instance level for security and compliance reasons, as instances with IP
    Forwarding enabled act as routers/packet forwarders. Because IP forwarding is
    rarely required, except when the virtual machine (VM) is used as a network virtual
    appliance, each Google Cloud VM instance should be reviewed to decide whether
    IP forwarding is really needed.

    '
  impact: 'With IP forwarding enabled, VM instances can act as routers and receive
    traffic addressed to other destinations, potentially creating security risks if
    not properly configured and monitored.

    '
  name: IP Forwarding Not Disabled for VM Instances
  reference:
  - https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/gcp/ComputeEngine/disable-ip-forwarding.html
  - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-routes
  remediation: 'Re-create your VM instances with IP forwarding disabled. Note that
    you cannot disable IP forwarding on an existing instance - you must create a new
    instance without the IP forwarding option.
