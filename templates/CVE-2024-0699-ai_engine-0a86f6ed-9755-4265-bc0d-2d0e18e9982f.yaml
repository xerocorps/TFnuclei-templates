    cvss-score: 6.6
  description: 'The AI Engine: Chatbots, Generators, Assistants, GPT 4 and more! plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type
    validation in the ''add_image_from_url'' function in all versions up to, and including,
    2.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor access
    and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible. CVE-2024-29100 is likely a duplicate of this
    issue.
