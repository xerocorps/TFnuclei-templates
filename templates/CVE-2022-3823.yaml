  description: The Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters in versions up to, and
    including, 2.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
