  description: 'If introspection is disabled on your target, Field Suggestion can
    allow users to still earn information on the GraphQL schema.

    By default, GraphQL backends have a feature for fields and operations suggestions.

    If you try to query a field but you have made a typo, GraphQL will attempt to
    suggest fields that are similar to the initial attempt.
