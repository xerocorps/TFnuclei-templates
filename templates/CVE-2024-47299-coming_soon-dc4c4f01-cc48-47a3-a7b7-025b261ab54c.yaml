  description: "The Website Builder by SeedProd \u2014 Theme Builder, Landing Page\
    \ Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 6.17.4\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\
    \ This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html\
    \ has been disabled.\n"
