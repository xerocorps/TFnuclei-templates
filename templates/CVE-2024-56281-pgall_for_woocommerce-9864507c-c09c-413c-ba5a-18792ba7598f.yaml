  description: "The \uC6CC\uB4DC\uD504\uB808\uC2A4 \uACB0\uC81C \uC2EC\uD50C\uD398\
    \uC774 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
