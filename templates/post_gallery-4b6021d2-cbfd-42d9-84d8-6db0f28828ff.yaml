  description: "The Post Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018src\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an\
    \ action such as clicking on a link.\n"
