  description: 'The Education Addon for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1
    via the naedu_elementor_template shortcode due to missing validation on a user
    controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
    access and above, to extract information from posts that are not public, including
    drafts, password protected, and restricted posts. This applies to posts created
    with Elementor only.
