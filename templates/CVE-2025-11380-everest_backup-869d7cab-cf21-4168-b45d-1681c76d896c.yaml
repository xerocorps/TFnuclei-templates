  description: "The Everest Backup \u2013 WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore\
    \ & Cloning Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of\
    \ data due to a missing capability check on the 'everest_process_status' AJAX\
    \ action in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to retrieve back-up file locations that can be subsequently\
    \ accessed and downloaded. This does require a back-up to be running in order\
    \ for an attacker to retrieve the back-up location.\n"
