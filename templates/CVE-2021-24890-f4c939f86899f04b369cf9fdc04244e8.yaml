  description: 'The Scripts Organizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads in versions up to, but not including, 3.0. This is due to missing
    capability checks in one of its AJAX actions that is accessible to unauthenticated
    users. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
