  description: "The FuseWP \u2013 WordPress User Sync to Email List & Marketing Automation\
    \ (Mailchimp, Constant Contact, ActiveCampaign etc.) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23.0.\
    \ This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_changes function.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or edit sync rules\
    \ via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
