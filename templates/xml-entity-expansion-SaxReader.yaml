  description: XML entity expansion vulnerabilities arise because the XML specification
    allows XML documents to define entities that reference other entities defined
    within the document. If this is done recursively to a significant depth, then
    the XML parser will consume exponentially increasing amounts of memory and processor
    resources as each level of recursion is processed.
