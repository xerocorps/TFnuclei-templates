  description: 'The Search in Place plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.104. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the feedback_action function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to submit plugin feedback on behalf of the site
    owner via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
