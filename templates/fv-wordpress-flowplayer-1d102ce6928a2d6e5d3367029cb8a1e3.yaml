  description: "The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018fv_player_preview\u2019 parameter\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 7.2.0.727 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
