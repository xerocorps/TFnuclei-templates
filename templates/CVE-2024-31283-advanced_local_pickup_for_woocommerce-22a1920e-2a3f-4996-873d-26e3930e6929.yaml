  description: 'The Advanced Local Pickup for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several
    functions in the ~/include/customizer/customizer-admin.php  file in versions up
    to, and including, 1.6.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to update plugin settings and send test emails.
