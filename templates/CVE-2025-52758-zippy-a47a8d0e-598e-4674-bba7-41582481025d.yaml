  description: 'The Zippy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and
    above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
