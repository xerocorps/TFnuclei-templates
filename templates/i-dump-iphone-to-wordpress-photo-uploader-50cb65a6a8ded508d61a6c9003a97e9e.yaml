  description: 'The iDump iPhone to WordPress Photo Uploader for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the uploader.php
    file in versions up to, and including, 1.8. This makes it possible for attackers
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
