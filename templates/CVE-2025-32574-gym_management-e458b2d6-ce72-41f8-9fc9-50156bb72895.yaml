  description: 'The WPGYM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions
    up to, and including, 65.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter
    and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to append
    additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract
    sensitive information from the database.
