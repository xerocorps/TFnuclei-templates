  description: 'Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is used to detect "Delete
    Security Solution" events within your Microsoft Azure cloud account. Activity
    log alerts get activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert occurs. In this case, the condition required is ''Whenever
    the Security Activity Log "Delete Security Solutions (Microsoft.Security/securitySolutions)"
    has "any" level, with "any" status and event is initiated by "any"''.

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Delete Security Solution"
    events, unauthorized or unwanted deletions might go unnoticed, leading to potential
    security risks.
