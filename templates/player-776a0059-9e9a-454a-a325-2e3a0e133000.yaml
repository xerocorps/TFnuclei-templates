  description: "The SpiderVPlayer for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018s_v_player_id\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and\
    \ including, 2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts\
    \ in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
