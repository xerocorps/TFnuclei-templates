  description: 'The WordPress Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the mo_sharing_app_value
    function as well as others that are reachable via AJAX action in versions up to,
    and including, 7.5.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    subscriber-level permissions and above, to change plugin settings.

    Additionally, some AJAX actions were missing nonce checks thus making them vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This enables unauthenticated attackers to invoke
    the corresponding functions, granted they can trick an administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.'
