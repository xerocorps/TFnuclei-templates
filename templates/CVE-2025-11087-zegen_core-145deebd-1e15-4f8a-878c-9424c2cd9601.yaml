  description: 'The Zegen Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This
    is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the ''/custom-font-code/custom-fonts-uploads.php''
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
