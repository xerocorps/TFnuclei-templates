  description: 'The YITH WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.0. This is due
    to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform actions
    on the REST API /wp-json/yith/wishlist/v1/lists endpoint (which uses permission_callback
    => ''__return_true'') and the AJAX delete_item handler (which only checks nonce
    validity without verifying object-level authorization). This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to disclose wishlist tokens for any user and subsequently
    delete wishlist items by chaining the REST API authorization bypass with the exposed
    delete_item nonce on shared wishlist pages and the AJAX handler''s missing object-level
    authorization check.
