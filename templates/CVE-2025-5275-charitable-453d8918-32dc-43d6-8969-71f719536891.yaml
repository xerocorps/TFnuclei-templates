  description: "The Charitable \u2013 Donation Plugin for WordPress \u2013 Fundraising\
    \ with Recurring Donations & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the privacy settings fields in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.8.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. This issue was partially\
    \ fixed in version 1.8.6.1 and fully fixed in version 1.8.6.2.\n"
