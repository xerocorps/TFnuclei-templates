  description: 'The Kali Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated
    Arbitrary Post Deletion in versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This is due to
    the kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file function lacking any privilege or user
    protections. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete any
    site post or page with the id parameter.
