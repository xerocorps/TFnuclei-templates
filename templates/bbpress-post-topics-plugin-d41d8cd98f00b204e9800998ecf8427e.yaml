  description: 'The Post Comments as bbPress Topics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via various parameters, such as `bbpress_topic[display-extras][xcount]`
    in versions up to, and including, 2.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    publishing capabilities, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
