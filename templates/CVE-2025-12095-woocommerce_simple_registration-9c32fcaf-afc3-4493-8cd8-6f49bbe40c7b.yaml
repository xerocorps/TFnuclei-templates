  description: 'The Simple Registration for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.8. This
    is due to missing nonce validation on the role requests admin page handler in
    the includes/display-role-admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to approve pending role requests and escalate user privileges via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
