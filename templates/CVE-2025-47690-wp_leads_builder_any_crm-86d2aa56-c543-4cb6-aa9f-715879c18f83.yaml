    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Lead Form Data Collection to CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due
    to a missing capability check on the save_thirdparty_form_title() function in
    all versions up to, and including, 3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options
    on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration
    to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative
    user access to a vulnerable site. There may be other functions affected by the
    same vulnerability.
