  description: 'The Think Responsive theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_settings_image.php
    file in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for attackers
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
