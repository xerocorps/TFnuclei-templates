  description: 'The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the image_upload_handle() function
    hooked via the ''add_booking_type'' route in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
