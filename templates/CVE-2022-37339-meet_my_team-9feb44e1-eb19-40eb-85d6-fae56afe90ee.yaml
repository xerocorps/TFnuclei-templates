  description: 'The Meet My Team plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
