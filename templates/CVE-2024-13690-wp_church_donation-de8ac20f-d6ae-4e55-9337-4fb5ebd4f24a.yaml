  description: 'The WP Church Donation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via several donation form submission parameters in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
