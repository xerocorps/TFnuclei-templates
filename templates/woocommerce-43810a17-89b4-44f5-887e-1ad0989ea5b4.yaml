  description: 'The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions before 8.4.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. IMPORTANT: There was a miscommunication
    and error in this vulnerability record where we initially reported version 8.5.0
    as patched, while 8.4.0 was still vulnerable. This issue was patched in version
    8.4.0 and only affects versions up to 8.3.0. Please rest assured knowing you can
    update the plugin to version 8.4.0 and this issue will be patched.
