  classification:

  description: 'The Campaign Monitor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.15. This is
    due the plugin not properly restricting direct access to /forms/views/admin/create.php
    and display_errors being enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other
    attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another
    vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
