  description: 'The Bit Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including,
    2.20.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
    For this to be exploitable, the PRO version needs to be installed and activated
    as well. Additionally a form with an advanced file upload element needs to be
    published.
