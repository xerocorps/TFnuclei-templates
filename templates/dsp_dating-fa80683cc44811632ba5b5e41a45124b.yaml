  description: 'The WPDating plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Upload in versions up to, and including, 7.4.1. This is due to missing file type
    validation on one of the plugin''s functions. While the source of information
    claims that this is a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that requires tricking
    an administrative user to click a link in order to exploit the vulnerability,
    we believe that this may be exploitable by unauthenticated users as well after
    analyzing the provided proof of concepts. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload malicious files to the server.
