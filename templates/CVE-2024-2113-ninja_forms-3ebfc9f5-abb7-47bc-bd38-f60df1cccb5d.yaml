  description: "The Ninja Forms Contact Form \u2013 The Drag and Drop Form Builder\
    \ for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This is due to missing or incorrect\
    \ nonce validation on the nf_download_all_subs AJAX action. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to trigger an export of a form's submission to\
    \ a publicly accessible location via a forged request granted they can trick a\
    \ site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
