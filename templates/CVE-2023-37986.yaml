  description: 'The YourMembership Single Sign On plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin settings in versions up to, and
    including, 1.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
