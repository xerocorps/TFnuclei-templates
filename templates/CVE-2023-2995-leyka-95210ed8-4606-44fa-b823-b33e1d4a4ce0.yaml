  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2023-2995
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 4.4
  description: 'The Leyka plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 3.30.3 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled. NOTE: The problem was communicated to the developer on May
    30, 2023, and was patched via a hot-fix in version 3.30.3 instead of a new release
    being rolled out.
