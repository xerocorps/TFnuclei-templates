  description: 'nsenter is a command-line utility in Linux that allows a user to enter
    into an existing namespace. It is commonly used for troubleshooting and managing
    namespaces in containerized environments. By using nsenter, users can enter into
    a specific namespace and execute commands within that namespace, which can be
    helpful for various system administration tasks.
