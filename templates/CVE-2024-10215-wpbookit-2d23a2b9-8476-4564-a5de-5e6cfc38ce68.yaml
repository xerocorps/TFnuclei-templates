  description: 'The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User
    Password Change in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This is due to the plugin
    providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization
    and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
