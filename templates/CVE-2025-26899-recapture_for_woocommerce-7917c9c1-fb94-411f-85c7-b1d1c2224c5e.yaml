  description: 'The Recapture for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.43. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
