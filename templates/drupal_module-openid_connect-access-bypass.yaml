  description: This module allows users to authenticate against an Oauth 2.0 / OpenID
    Connect identity provider to login to your Drupal site. The module doesnt sufficiently
    protect against unauthorized local access, by way of using the password reset
    facility, for users who are supposed to only be able to log in through the identity
    provider. This creates a scenario where after such a user is blocked from logging
    in through the identity provider but not explicitly blocked in Drupal, they are
    still able to log in by sending themselves a Drupal password reset e-mail.
