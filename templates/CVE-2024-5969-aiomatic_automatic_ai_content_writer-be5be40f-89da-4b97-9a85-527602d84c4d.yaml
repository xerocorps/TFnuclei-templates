  description: 'The AIomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary email sending vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5.
    This is due to insufficient limitations on the email recipient and the content
    in the ''aiomatic_send_email'' function which are reachable via AJAX. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with any content to any
    recipient.
