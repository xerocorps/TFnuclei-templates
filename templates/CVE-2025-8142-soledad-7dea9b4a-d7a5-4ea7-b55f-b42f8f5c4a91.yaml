  description: 'The Soledad theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.7 via the ''header_layout'' parameter.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
    and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing
    the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access
    controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php
    file types can be uploaded and included.
