  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''order_mail'' setting in versions up to, and including,
    2.11.22. This is due to insufficient sanitization on the order_mail field and
    a lack of escaping on output. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts via the
    General Setting page that will execute when an administrator accesses the E-mail
    Setting page.
