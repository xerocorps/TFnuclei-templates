  description: The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to missing capability checks on several REST API endpoints in versions
    up to, and including, 2.6.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to perform unauthorized actions such as uploading arbitrary files that can be
    used for remote code execution.
