  description: 'The Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ) plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    2.5.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the reset_settings() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin''s settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
