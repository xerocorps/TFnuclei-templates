  description: 'The Empowerment theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 via deserialization of untrusted input.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
    and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
    software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code.
