  description: "The Responsive Lightbox2 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018hyperlink\u2019 attribute in versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page."
