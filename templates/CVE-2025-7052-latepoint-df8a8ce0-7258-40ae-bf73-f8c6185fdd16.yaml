  description: "The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request\
    \ Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.94. This is due to missing\
    \ nonce validation on the change_password() function of its customer_cabinet__change_password\
    \ AJAX route. The plugin hooks this endpoint via wp_ajax and wp_ajax_nopriv but\
    \ does not verify a nonce or user capability before resetting the user\u2019s\
    \ password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who trick a logged-in\
    \ customer (or, with \u201CWP users as customers\u201D enabled, an administrator)\
    \ into visiting a malicious link to take over their account.\n"
