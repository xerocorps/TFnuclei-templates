  description: The WP phpMyAdmin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including 5.2.0.3 due to the use of add_query_arg
    with insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via a URL
    that executes if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
