    cvss-score: 6.8
  description: 'The WP User Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Deletion in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.12. This is due to insufficient
    validation of user-supplied file paths in the profile update functionality combined
    with improper handling of array inputs by PHP''s filter_input() function. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to delete arbitrary files on the server via the ''current_user_avatar''
    parameter in a two-stage attack which can make remote code execution possible.
    This only affects sites with the custom avatar setting enabled.
