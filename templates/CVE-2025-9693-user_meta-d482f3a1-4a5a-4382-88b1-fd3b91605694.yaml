  description: "The User Meta \u2013 User Profile Builder and User management plugin\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient\
    \ file path validation in the postInsertUserProcess function in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,\
    \ which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted\
    \ (such as wp-config.php).\n"
