  description: "The Memberpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018message\u2019 and 'error' parameters in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.11.26 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link. Note - the issue was partially\
    \ patched in 1.11.25, but could still potentially be exploited under some circumstances.\n"
