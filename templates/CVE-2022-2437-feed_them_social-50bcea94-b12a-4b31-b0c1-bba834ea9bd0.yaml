  description: "The Feed Them Social \u2013 for Twitter feed, Youtube and more plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'fts_url'\
    \ parameter in versions up to, and including 2.9.8.5. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize\
    \ the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety\
    \ of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that\
    \ the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.\n"
