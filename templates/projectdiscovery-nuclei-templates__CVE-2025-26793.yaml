  classification:
    epss-percentile: 0.92937

  description: 'The Web GUI configuration panel of Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount)
    Enterphone MESH through 2024 ships with default credentials (username freedom,
    password viscount). The administrator is not prompted to change these credentials
    on initial configuration, and changing the credentials requires many steps. Attackers
    can use the credentials over the Internet via mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet to
    gain access to dozens of Canadian and U.S. apartment buildings and obtain building
    residents'' PII. NOTE- the Supplier''s perspective is that the "vulnerable systems
    are not following manufacturers'' recommendations to change the default password."

    '
  impact: 'Attackers can gain unauthorized access to building management systems using
    default credentials, potentially exposing residents'' personally identifiable
    information and controlling access to apartment buildings.
