  description: 'The bbPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.11. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the bbp_user_add_role_on_register() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to
    that of a bbPress Keymaster via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Rather than
    implementing a nonce check to provide protection against this vulnerability, which
    would break functionality, the plugin no longer makes it possible to select a
    role during registration.
