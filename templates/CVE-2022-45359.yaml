    \ to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and capability\
    \ checks in the import_actions_from_settings_panel function in versions up to,\

    \ to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote\
    \ code execution possible.\_This is being actively exploited."
