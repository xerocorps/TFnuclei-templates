  description: "The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award\
    \ Winner \u2014 Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file\
    \ deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'process_export_delete'\
    \ and 'process_import_delete' functions in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 4.1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily\
    \ lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
