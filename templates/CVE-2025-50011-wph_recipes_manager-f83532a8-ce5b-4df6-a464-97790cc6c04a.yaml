  description: "The Recipes manager \u2013 WPH plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations\
    \ where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
