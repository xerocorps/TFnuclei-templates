  description: 'The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''homey_verify_user_manually'' function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to update verify an user via a forged request,
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
