  description: "The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar \u2013 Amelia plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin utilizing Symfony and leaving display_errors\
    \ on within test files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other\
    \ attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another\
    \ vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.\n"
