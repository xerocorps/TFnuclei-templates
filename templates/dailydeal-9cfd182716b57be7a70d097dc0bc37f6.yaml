  description: The Dailydeal by Templatic theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads via CSRF due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'upload-file.php'
    file in versions up to, and including, 3.0.10. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
