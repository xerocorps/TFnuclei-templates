  description: 'The AHAthat Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the aha_plugin_page() function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete AHA pages via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
