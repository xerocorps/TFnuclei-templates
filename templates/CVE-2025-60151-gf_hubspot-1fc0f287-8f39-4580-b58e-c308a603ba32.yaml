  description: 'The WP Gravity Forms HubSpot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This is due to insufficient
    validation on the redirect url supplied. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully
    trick them into performing an action.
