  description: 'The W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.12 via _parse_dynamic_mfunc
    . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the
    server when comments are enabled and a post has been incorrectly injected with
    the mfunc tags. Please note we consider this to be a theoretical issue, and as
    such we rejected the original report from the researcher who then submitted this
    to WPScan. WPScan assigned a CVE ID, but we do not agree that this is a true security
    vulnerability. Exploitation of this issue is theoretical and requires gaining
    access to a secret value much like gaining access to a password.
