  description: 'The Indeed Job Importer WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters
    found in the ~/indeed-job-importer/trunk/indeed-job-importer.php file which allowed
    attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in
    versions up to and including 1.0.5. This affects multi-site installations where
    unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html
    is disabled.
