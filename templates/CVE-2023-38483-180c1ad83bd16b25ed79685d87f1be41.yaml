  description: 'The Instant CSS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access and modification of data due to missing capability checks on several functions
    called via AJAX actions in the ~/classes/class.instantcss_ajax.php file in versions
    up to, and including, 1.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level access and above, to perform a wide variety of actions such
    as retrieving css, theme, and minify data, along with updating the options for
    those. The unprotected AJAX actions present can be used to exploit a site via
    Cross-Site Scripting as well.
