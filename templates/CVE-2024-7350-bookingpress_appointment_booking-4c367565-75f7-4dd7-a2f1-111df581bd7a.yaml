  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Online Scheduling Plugin\
    \ \u2013 BookingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass\
    \ in versions 1.1.6 to 1.1.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying\
    \ a user's identity prior to logging them in when completing a booking. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as registered users, including\
    \ administrators, if they have access to that user's email.  This is only exploitable\
    \ when the 'Auto login user after successful booking' setting is enabled.\n"
