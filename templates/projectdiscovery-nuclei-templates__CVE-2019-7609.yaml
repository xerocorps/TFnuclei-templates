  description: Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution
    flaw in the Timelion visualizer. An attacker with access to the Timelion application
    could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could
    possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of
    the Kibana process on the host system.
  impact: 'Arbitrary code execution can result in unauthorized access, data leakage,
    and system compromise.
