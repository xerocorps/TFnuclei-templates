  description: 'The Pollcaster Shortcode Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''height'' parameter in the ''pollcaster'' shortcode
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
