  description: 'The Mr. Murphy - Custom Dress Tailoring Clothing WordPress Theme theme
    for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to 1.2.12.1
    (exclusive) via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
    in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless
    another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a
    POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
    system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files,
    retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
