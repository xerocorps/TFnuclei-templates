  description: "The ProfileGrid \u2013 User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing\
    \ capability check on the pm_remove_file_attachment() function in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.9.3.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary user meta which\
    \ can do things like deny an administrator's access to their site. .\n"
