  description: 'The eewee admin custom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.2.4. This is due to
    missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to an admin via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
