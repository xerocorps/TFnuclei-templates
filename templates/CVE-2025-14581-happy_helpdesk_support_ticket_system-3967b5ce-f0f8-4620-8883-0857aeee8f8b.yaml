  description: "The HAPPY \u2013 Helpdesk Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the\
    \ 'submit_form_reply' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access\
    \ and above, to submit replies to arbitrary support tickets by manipulating the\
    \ 'happy_topic_id' parameter, regardless of whether they are the ticket owner\
    \ or have been assigned to the ticket.\n"
