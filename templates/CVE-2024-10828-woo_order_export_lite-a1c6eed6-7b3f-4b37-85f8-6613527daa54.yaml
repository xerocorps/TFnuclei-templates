  description: 'The Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.5
    via deserialization of untrusted input during Order export when the "Try to convert
    serialized values" option is enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows
    attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
