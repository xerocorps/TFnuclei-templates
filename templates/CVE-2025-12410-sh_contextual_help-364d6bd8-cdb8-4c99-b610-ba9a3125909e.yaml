  description: 'The SH Contextual Help plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in the sh_contextual_help_dashboard_widget() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings
    and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
