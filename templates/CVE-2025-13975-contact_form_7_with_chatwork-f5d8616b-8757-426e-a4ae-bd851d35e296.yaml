  description: 'The Contact Form 7 with ChatWork plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''api_token'' and ''roomid'' settings in
    all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses the settings page. This only affects multi-site
    installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
