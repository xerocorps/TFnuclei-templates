  description: 'The Brizy Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address
    Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.4.18. This is due to an implicit
    trust of user-supplied IP addresses in an ''X-Forwarded-For'' HTTP header for
    the purpose of validating allowed IP addresses against a Maintenance Mode whitelist.
    Supplying a whitelisted IP address within the ''X-Forwarded-For'' header allows
    maintenance mode to be bypassed and may result in the disclosure of potentially
    sensitive information or allow access to restricted functionality.
