  description: 'The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on various functions including the affiliates_menu
    method. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliate
    records, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
