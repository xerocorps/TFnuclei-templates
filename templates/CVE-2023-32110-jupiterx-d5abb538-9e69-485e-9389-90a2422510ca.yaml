  description: "The JupiterX theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 3.0.0 via the print_pane function. This allows\
    \ authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
