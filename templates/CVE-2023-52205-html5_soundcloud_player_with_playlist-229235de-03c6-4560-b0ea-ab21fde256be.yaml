  description: 'The HTML5 SoundCloud Player with Playlist Free plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0
    via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP
    chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
    delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
