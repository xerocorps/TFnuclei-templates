  description: 'Scoold is a Q&A and a knowledge sharing platform for teams. A semicolon
    path injection vulnerability was found on the /api;/config endpoint. By appending
    a semicolon in the URL, attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorised
    access to sensitive configuration data. Furthermore, PUT requests on the /api;/config
    endpoint while setting the Content-Type- application/hocon header allow unauthenticated
    attackers to file reading via HOCON file inclusion. This allows attackers to retrieve
    sensitive information such as configuration files from the server, which can be
    leveraged for further exploitation. The vulnerability has been fixed in Scoold
    1.64.0. A workaround would be to disable the Scoold API with scoold.api_enabled
    = false.

    '
  impact: 'Attackers can bypass authentication and read sensitive configuration data
    from the Scoold API.
