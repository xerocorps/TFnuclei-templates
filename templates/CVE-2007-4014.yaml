  classification:

  description: The Blix <= 0.9.1, Blixed <= 1.0, BlixKrieg <= 2.2 themes for WordPress
    are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 's' parameter due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link. This may be related to  CVE-2007-2757.
