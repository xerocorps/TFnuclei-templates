  description: 'The G Web Pro Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ''q'' parameter in all versions up to,
    and including, 2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
