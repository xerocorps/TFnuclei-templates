  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Ultimate Member plugin 2.0.39 for WordPress.
    It allows unauthorized profile and cover picture modification. It is possible
    to modify the profile and cover picture of any user once one is connected. One
    can also modify the profiles and cover pictures of privileged users. To perform
    such a modification, one first needs to (for example) intercept an upload-picture
    request and modify the user_id parameter.
