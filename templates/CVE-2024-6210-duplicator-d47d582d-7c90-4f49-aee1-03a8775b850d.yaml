  description: 'The Duplicator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to obtain the full path to instances, which they may be able to use
    in combination with other vulnerabilities or to simplify reconnaissance work.
    On its own, this information is of very limited use.
