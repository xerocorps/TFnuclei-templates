  description: 'The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full
    Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to improper
    error handling in the PDF upload functionality that exposes server filesystem
    paths and stack traces in error messages. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used
    to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and
    requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
