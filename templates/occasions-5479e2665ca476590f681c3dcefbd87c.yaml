  description: The Occasions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation in the 'occasions.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions which
    can result in XSS via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
