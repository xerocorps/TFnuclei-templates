  description: 'The AnyWhere Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.11 via the ''INSERT_ELEMENTOR''
    shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and
    above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they
    should not have access to.
