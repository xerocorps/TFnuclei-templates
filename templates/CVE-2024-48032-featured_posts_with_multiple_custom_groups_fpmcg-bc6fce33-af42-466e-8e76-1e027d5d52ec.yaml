  description: 'The Featured Posts with Multiple Custom Groups (FPMCG) plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and
    including, 4.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
