  description: "The Giveaways and Contests by RafflePress \u2013 Get More Website\
    \ Traffic, Email Subscribers, and Social Followers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Giveaway Description value in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.12.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level\
    \ access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
