  description: "The BrainCert \u2013 HTML5 Virtual Classroom plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action\
    \ such as clicking on a link.\n"
