  description: 'The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the copy_post_image() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.20. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible. This only impacts sites that have allow_url_fopen
    set to `On`, the post creation form enabled along with a file upload field for
    the post
