  description: 'The Favicon Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the output_sub_admin_page_0 function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. The plugin author deleted the functionality of the
    plugin to patch this issue and close the plugin, we recommend seeking an alternative
    to this plugin.
