  description: 'The Responsive theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in all versions up to 5.0.3.1 (exclusive) due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
