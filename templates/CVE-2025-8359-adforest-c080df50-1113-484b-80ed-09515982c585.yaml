  description: 'The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass
    in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly
    verifying a user''s identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators,
    without access to a password.
