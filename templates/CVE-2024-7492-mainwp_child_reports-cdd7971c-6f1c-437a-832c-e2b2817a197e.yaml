  description: 'The MainWP Child Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the network_options_action() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options that can
    be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This
    is only exploitable on multisite instances.
