  description: 'The Ahmeti Wp Timeline plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
