  description: "The Slider, Gallery, and Carousel by MetaSlider \u2013 Image Slider,\
    \ Video Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 3.94.0 via deserialization of untrusted input.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access\
    \ and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable\
    \ software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin\
    \ or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is\
    \ present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it\
    \ may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
