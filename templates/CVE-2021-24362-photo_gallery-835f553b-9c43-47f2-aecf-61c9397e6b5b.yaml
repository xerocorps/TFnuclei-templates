  description: "The Photo Gallery by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery WordPress\
    \ plugin before 1.5.75 did not ensure that uploaded SVG files added to a gallery\
    \ do not contain malicious content. As a result, users allowed to add images to\
    \ gallery can upload an SVG file containing JavaScript code, which will be executed\
    \ when accessing the image directly (ie in the /wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/\
    \ folder), leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue\n"
