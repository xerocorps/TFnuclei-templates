  description: 'The PropertyHive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.9 via deserialization of untrusted
    input through the ''body'' parameter. This makes it possible for attackers, with
    subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
    is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
    delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
