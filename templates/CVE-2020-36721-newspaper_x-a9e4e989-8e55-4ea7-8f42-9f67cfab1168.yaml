  description: 'The Brilliance <= 1.2.7, Activello <= 1.4.0, and Newspaper X <= 1.3.1
    themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Plugin Activation/Deactivation. This is
    due to the ''activello_activate_plugin'' and ''activello_deactivate_plugin'' functions
    in the ''inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php'' file missing capability
    and security checks/nonces. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins installed on a vulnerable site.
