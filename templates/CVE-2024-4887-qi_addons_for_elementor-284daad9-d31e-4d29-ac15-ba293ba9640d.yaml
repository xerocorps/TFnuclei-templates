  description: 'The Qi Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.2 via the ''behavior''
    attributes found in the qi_addons_for_elementor_blog_list shortcode. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,
    to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution
    of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
    sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be
    uploaded and included. Please note that this requires an attacker to create a
    non-existent directory or target an instance where file_exists won''t return false
    with a non-existent directory in the path, in order to successfully exploit.
