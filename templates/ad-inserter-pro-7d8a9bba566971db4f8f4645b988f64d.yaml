  description: The Ad Inserter Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Modification in versions 2.7.15 via unknown mechanisms. The Wordfence Threat
    Intelligence team conducted a thorough review of the vulnerable plugin and could
    not determine a vulnerable component in the plugin, which leads us to believe
    there may have been some element on the plugin developers management side that
    may have made file modification possible without the appropriate authorizations.
    Reports indicate that attackers were deleting wp-config.php files to reset the
    site, which leads us to believe the vulnerability made arbitrary file deletion
    or modification possible.
