  description: "The myCred \u2013 Loyalty Points and Rewards plugin for WordPress\
    \ and WooCommerce \u2013 Give Points, Ranks, Badges, Cashback, WooCommerce rewards,\
    \ and WooCommerce credits for Gamification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's mycred_link shortcode in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 2.7.4 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an\
    \ injected page.\n"
