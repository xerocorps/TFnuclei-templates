  description: 'The Elated Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin not
    properly logging in a user with the data that was previously verified through
    the ''eltdf_membership_check_facebook_user'' and the ''eltdf_membership_login_user_from_social_network''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as administrative
    users, as long as they have an existing account on the site which can easily be
    created by default through the temp user functionality, and access to the administrative
    user''s email.
