  description: 'The BSK PDF Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.1 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the
    SVG file. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
