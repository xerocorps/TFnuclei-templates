  description: 'Ensure that Server-Side Encryption (SSE) is using customer-managed
    keys (CMKs) instead of service-managed keys to protect your OSS data at rest.
    SSE with customer-managed keys (also known as Bring Your Own Key - BYOK) enables
    you to have full control over the encryption and decryption process and meet strict
    compliance requirements.
