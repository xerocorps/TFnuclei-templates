  description: 'The Attorney theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
