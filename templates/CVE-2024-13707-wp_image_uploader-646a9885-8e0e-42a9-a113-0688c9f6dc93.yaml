  description: 'The WP Image Uploader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the gky_image_uploader_main_function() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
