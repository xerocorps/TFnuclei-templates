  description: 'The The Fashion - Model Agency One Page Beauty Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4
    via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
    software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or
    theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present
    via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow
    the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
    data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
