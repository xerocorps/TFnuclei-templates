  description: "The Album Gallery \u2013 WordPress Gallery plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3\
    \ via deserialization of untrusted input from gallery meta. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject a\
    \ PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which\
    \ means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing\
    \ a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional\
    \ plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to\
    \ perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute\
    \ code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
