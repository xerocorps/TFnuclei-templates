  description: 'Ensure that critical service APIs are enabled for your GCP projects
    to gain access to essential functionalities and services provided by Google Cloud
    Platform (GCP), manage your project resources efficiently, enhance the security
    of your cloud environment, and track your usage and billing. The critical service
    APIs include, but are not limited to, Identity and Access Management (IAM) API,
    Compute Engine API, Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Pub/Sub API, Cloud Key Management
    Service (KMS) API, and Cloud Logging API.

    '
  impact: 'Disabling critical service APIs can prevent the proper management and security
    of GCP resources, potentially leading to service disruptions or compromised security.

    '
  name: Critical Service APIs Not Enabled
  reference:
  - https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable
  remediation: 'Enable the necessary service APIs via the GCP Console or the gcloud
    command-line tool for each project where they are found to be disabled.
