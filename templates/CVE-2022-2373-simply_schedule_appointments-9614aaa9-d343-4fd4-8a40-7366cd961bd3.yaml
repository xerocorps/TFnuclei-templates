  description: 'The Simply Schedule Appointments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to sensitive information exposure in versions up to, and including 1.5.7.5 due
    to missing capability checks on the /wp-json/ssa/v1/users REST API endpoint. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve a list of email addresses
    associated with the users that are registered on the site.
