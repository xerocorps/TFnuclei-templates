  description: 'The Blog Designer - Post and Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcodes in versions up to,
    and including, 2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes like ''design''. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page
