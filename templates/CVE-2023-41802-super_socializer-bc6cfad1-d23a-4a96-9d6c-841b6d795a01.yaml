    cvss-score: 4.3
  description: 'The Super Socializer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery due to missing nonce checks on several functions such as heateor_ss_twitcount_notification_read,
    heateor_ss_gdpr_notification_read, heateor_ss_fb_redirection_notification_read,
    heateor_ss_twitter_callback_notification_read, heateor_ss_linkedin_redirect_url_notification_read,
    heateor_ss_fb_count_notification_read, heateor_ss_twitter_new_callback_notification_read,
    and more in versions up to, and including, 7.13.54. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to mark messages as read, via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
