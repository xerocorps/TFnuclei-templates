  description: "The Patreon WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site\
    \ Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.9. If exploited, this\
    \ bug can be used to overwrite the \u201Cwp_capabilities\u201D meta, which contains\
    \ the affected user account\u2019s roles and privileges. Doing this would essentially\
    \ lock them out of the site, blocking them from accessing paid content.  This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make a logged in user overwrite\
    \ or create arbitrary user metadata on the victim\u2019s account once visited\
    \ via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
