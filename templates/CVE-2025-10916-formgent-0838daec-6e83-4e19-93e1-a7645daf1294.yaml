  description: "The FormGent \u2013 Next-Gen AI Form Builder for WordPress with Multi-Step,\
    \ Quizzes, Payments & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file\
    \ deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wp-json/formgent/responses/attachments\
    \ REST endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which\
    \ can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such\
    \ as wp-config.php).\n"
