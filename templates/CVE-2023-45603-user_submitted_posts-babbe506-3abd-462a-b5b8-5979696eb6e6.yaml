  description: 'The User Submitted Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the usp_attach_images function  in
    versions up to, and including, 20230902. This makes it possible for unauthenticatedattackers
    to upload arbitrary files as long as the extension does not contain ''php'' on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
