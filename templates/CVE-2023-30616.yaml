  description: The Form Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the get_requests() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to submit forms on behalf of another user via a forged request granted
    they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
