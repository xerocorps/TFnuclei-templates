  description: 'The Send email only on Reply to My Comment plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the subscribe_reloaded_update_option()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s
    settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
