  description: 'The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthenticated arbitrary back-up downloads due to insufficient filename randomization
    that made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to brute force back-up filenames
    in unique situations in versions up to, and including, 7.14. This would make it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to discover information from files contained
    in the back-ups that could be used to aid further attacks or lead to simply sensitive
    information disclosure.
