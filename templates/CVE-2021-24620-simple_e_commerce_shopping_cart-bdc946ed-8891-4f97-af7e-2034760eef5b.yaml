  description: 'The Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions
    up to, and including, 3.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the simpleecommcart-products
    page, and missing file type validation on the Downloadable Digital product file.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files,
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
