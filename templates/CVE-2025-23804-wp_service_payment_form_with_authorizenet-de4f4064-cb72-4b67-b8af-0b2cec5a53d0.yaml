  description: 'The WP Service Payment Form With Authorize.net plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    2.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
