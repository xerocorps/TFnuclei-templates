  description: This module allows you to turn various data sources (Eg CSV or JSON
    file) into interactive visualisation. The DVF module provides a field (storage,
    widget & formatter) that can be added to any entity.  This module uses two third-party
    JS libraries having from low to medium vulnerabilities. One of the vulnerabilities
    is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability that may affect Drupal sites as a Persistent
    Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (i.e. not reflected). This release updates
    the libraries. The issue is mitigated by the fact an attacker needs the permission
    to create or edit content that is displayed using the Data Visualization Framework.
