  description: NETGEAR DGN2200v1 router contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.
    It does not require authentication if a page has ".jpg", ".gif", or "ess_" substrings
    but matches the entire URL. Any page on the device can therefore be accessed,
    including those that require authentication, by appending a GET variable with
    the relevant substring.
