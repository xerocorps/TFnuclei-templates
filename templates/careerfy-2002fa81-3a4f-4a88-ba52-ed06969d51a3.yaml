  description: 'The Careerfy - Job Board WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''Career Level'', ''Experience'', ''Gender'',
    ''Industry'', ''Qualifications'', ''Job Description'', and ''Full Address'' fields
    in versions up to, and including, 3.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
