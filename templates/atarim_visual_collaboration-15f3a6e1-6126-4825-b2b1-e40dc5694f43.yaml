  description: 'The Atarim - Client Interface plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized use of functionality due to a missing capability check on the avc_send_invitations
    and avc_delete_invitations functions in versions up to, and including, 3.9.1.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary accounts
    (and the content they created) on the site. The creation of accounts is also possible
    although new accounts are limited to the default role or subscriber, whichever
    is higher.
