  description: 'The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.7.8. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in the php/qmn_options_questions_tab.php file. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
