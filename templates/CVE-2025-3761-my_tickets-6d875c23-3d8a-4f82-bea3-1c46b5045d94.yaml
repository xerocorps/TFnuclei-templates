  description: "The My Tickets \u2013 Accessible Event Ticketing plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.16. This is due to the mt_save_profile() function not appropriately restricting\
    \ access to unauthorized users to update roles. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to that\
    \ of an administrator.\n"
