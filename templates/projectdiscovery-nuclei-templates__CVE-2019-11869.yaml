  description: 'WordPress Yuzo Related Posts plugin before 5.12.94 is vulnerable to
    cross-site scripting

    because it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the

    request comes from an admin user (it actually only verifies that the

    request is for an admin page). An unauthenticated attacker can consequently inject

    a payload into the plugin settings, such as the

    yuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to potential
    data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the affected website.
