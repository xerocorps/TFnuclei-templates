  description: 'Ensure that a Microsoft Azure activity log alert is fired whenever
    a "Delete Azure SQL Database" event is triggered within your cloud account. An
    Azure activity log alert fires each time the action event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert configuration is triggered. The alert condition that this
    conformity rule searches for is "Whenever the Activity Log has an event with Category=''Administrative'',
    Signal name=''Delete Azure SQL Database (Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases)''".

    '
  impact: 'Failing to monitor and alert on "Delete Azure SQL Database" events can
    lead to unauthorized or unnoticed deletions, posing a significant risk to data
    integrity and compliance.
