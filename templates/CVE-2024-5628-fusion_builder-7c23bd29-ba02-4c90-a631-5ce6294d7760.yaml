  description: 'The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & eCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s fusion_button shortcode
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.9 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This
    vulnerability was partially fixed in 3.11.9. Additional hardening for alternate
    attack vectors was added to version 3.11.10.
