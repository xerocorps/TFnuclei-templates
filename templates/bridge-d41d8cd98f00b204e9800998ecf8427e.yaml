  description: 'Helper plugins packaged with Bridge theme possess an Open Redirect
    vulnerability, allowing a malicious actor to create links to the site that redirect
    people to malicious domains.

    The Bridge theme, Qode Instagram Widget plugin, and Qode Twitter Feed plugin for
    WordPress are vulnerable to open redirects via the url parameter due to missing
    validation on the redirect location, that makes it possible for attackers to redirect
    unsuspecting users to malicious sites. This affects versions up to 18.2.1 in the
    Bridge theme, versions up to 2.0.2 in the Instagram widget plugin, and versions
    up to 2.0.1 in the Twitter feed plugin, and can be exploited by unauthenticated
    users.'
