  description: 'The Product Import Export for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    ''image_library_attachment'' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager access and
    above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
