  description: 'The Recently Viewed Products plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via deserialization
    of untrusted input from the ''rvpguest'' cookie value. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present
    in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or
    theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
    files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
