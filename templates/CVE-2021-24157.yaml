  description: Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle has a feature to add custom scripts to the header
    and footer of a page or post. There were no checks to verify that a user had the
    unfiltered_html capability prior to saving the script tags, thus allowing lower-level
    users to inject scripts that could potentially be malicious in versions up to,
    and including 2.10.2.
