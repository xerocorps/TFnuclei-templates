  description: 'The WP-UserOnline plugin for WordPress has multiple Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting vulnerabilities in versions up to, and including 2.88.0. This is due
    to the fact that all fields in the "Naming Conventions" section do not properly
    sanitize user input, nor escape it on output. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject JavaScript code into the
    setting that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This only
    affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
    disabled.
