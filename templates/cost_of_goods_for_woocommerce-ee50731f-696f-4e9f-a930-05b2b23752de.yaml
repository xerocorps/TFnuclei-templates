  description: 'The Cost of Goods for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.6. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_costs function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit or save of prices via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
