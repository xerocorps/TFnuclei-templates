    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018status\u2019\
    \ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.1 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
