  description: 'The WPC Frequently Bought Together for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing
    capability check on the ajax_add_rule, ajax_add_combination, and ajax_search_term
    functions in versions up to, and including, 7.1.9. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to add rules
    and combinations as well as search terms.
