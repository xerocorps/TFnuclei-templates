  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Login by Auth0 plugin before 4.0.0
    for WordPress. It has numerous fields that can contain data that is pulled from
    different sources. One issue with this is that the data isn''t sanitized, and
    no input validation is performed, before the exporting of the user data. This
    can lead to (at least) CSV injection if a crafted Excel document is uploaded.
