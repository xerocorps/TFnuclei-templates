  description: Spring MVC Framework versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior
    to 4.3.15 and older unsupported are vulnerable to local file inclusion because
    they allow applications to configure Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g.
    CSS, JS, images). A malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted
    URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access
    or information disclosure.
