  description: The WP All Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the wp_all_backup_admin_init() function called via admin_init.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform multiple actions
    such as deleting back-ups, starting back-ups, and restoring back-ups via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
