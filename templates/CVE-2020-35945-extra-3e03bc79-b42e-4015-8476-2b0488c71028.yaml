  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Divi Builder plugin, Divi theme, and
    Divi Extra theme before 4.5.3 for WordPress. Authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    or above capabilities, can upload arbitrary files, including .php files. This
    occurs because the check for file extensions is on the client side rather than
    server side.
