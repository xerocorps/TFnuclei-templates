  description: 'The Restore Permanently delete Post or Page Data plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rp_dpo_dpa_ajax_dp_delete_data()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete data
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
