  description: 'The Download Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to an insufficient capability check on several REST-API routes related
    to reporting in versions up to, and including, 4.7.60. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to
    view user data and other sensitive information intended for administrators.
