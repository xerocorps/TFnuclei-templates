  description: 'The Checkout with Cash App on WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ''_wp_http_referer'' parameter
    in several files in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
