  description: 'The Reviews Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Denial of Service
    in versions before 1.2.14. This is due to an unknown part of the file post/page
    of the component Rating Submission Handler. The manipulation with an unknown input
    leads to a denial of service vulnerability. This makes it possible for authentication
    attackers, a authentication is necessary for exploitation to cause a Denial of
    Service in the review section when an authenticated user submit such rating and
    the reviews are set to be displayed on the post/page.
