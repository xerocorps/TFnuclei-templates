  description: "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload \u2013 Contact Form 7 plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.3.6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the dnd_upload_cf7_upload and dnd_codedropz_upload_delete functions. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload or delete files via\
    \ a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
