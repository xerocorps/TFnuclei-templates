  description: 'The FoodBakery theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.9 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on the ''location'' parameter. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
