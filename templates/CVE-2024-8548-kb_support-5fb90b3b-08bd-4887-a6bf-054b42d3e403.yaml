    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform multiple administrative\
    \ actions, such as replying to arbitrary tickets, updating the status of any post,\
    \ deleting any post, adding notes to tickets, flagging or unflagging tickets,\
    \ and adding or removing ticket participants.\n"
