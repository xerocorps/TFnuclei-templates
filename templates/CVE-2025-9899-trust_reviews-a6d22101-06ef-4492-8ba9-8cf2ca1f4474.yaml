  description: 'The Trust Reviews plugin for Google, Tripadvisor, Yelp, Airbnb and
    other platforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the feed_save function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to create or modify feed entries via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
