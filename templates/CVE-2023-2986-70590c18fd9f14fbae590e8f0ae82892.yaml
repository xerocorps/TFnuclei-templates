  description: 'The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 5.14.2. This is due
    to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during the abandoned cart
    link decode through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in
    as users who have abandoned the cart, who are typically customers. Further security
    hardening was introduced in version 5.15.1 that ensures sites are no longer vulnerable
    through historical check-out links, and additional hardening was introduced in
    version 5.15.2 that ensured null key values wouldn''t permit the authentication
    bypass.
