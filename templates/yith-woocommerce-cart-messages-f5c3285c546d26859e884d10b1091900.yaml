  description: 'Several YITHEMES plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the create_log_file function. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
    and above, to download the logs of the plugin which can contain sensitive information.
    Please note that the unpatched plugins from this developer are the FREE versions
    of the plugin that were available on the WordPress.org repository. The developer
    is still maintaining the premium versions of the plugins which have been patched.
