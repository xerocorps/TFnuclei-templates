  description: 'The Booking Calendar and Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.3. This is
    due to the plugin not properly verifying a user''s identity prior to logging them
    in. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users
    which makes privilege escalation possible.
