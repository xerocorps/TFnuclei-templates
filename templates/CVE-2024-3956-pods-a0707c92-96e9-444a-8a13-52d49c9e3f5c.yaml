  description: "The Pods \u2013 Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Pod Form widget in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an\
    \ injected page.\n"
