  description: NETGEAR ProSAFE Plus  before 2.6.0.43 is susceptible to unauthenticated
    remote code execution. Any HTML page is allowed as a valid endpoint to submit
    POST requests, allowing debug action via the submitId and debugCmd parameters.
    The problem is publicly exposed in the login.html webpage, which has to be publicly
    available to perform login requests but does not implement any restriction for
    executing debug actions. This will allow attackers to execute system commands.
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
