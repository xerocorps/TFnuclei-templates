  description: 'The Featured Posts with Multiple Custom Groups (FPMCG) plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
