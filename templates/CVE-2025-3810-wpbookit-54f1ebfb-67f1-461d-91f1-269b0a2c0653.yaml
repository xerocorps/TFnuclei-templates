  description: 'The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    details like password and email through the edit_profile_data() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user''s email
    addresses and passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access
    to their account.
