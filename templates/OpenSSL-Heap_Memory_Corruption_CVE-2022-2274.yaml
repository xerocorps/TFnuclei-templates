  description: The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation
    for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA
    implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory
    corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory
    corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine
    performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA
    private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64
    architecture are affected by this issue.
