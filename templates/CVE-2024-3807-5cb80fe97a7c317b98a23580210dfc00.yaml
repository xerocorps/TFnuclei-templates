  description: 'The Porto theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in all versions up to, and including, 7.1.0 via ''porto_page_header_shortcode_type'',
    ''slideshow_type'' and ''post_layout'' post meta. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute
    arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those
    files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
    code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included. This
    was partially patched in version 7.1.0 and fully patched in version 7.1.1.
