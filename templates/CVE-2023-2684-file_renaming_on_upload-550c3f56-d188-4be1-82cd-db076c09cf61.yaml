  description: 'The File Renaming on Upload  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including,
    2.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
