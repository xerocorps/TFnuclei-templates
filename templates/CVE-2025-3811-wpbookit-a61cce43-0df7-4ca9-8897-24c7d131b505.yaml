  description: 'The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    details like email through the edit_newdata_customer_callback() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user''s email
    addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user''s password
    and gain access to their account.
