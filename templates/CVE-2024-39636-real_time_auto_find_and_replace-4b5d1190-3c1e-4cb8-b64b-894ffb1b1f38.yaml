  description: 'The Better Find and Replace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.1 via deserialization
    of untrusted input from the ''str'' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
    software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code.
