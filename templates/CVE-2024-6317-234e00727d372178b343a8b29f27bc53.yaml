  description: 'The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and
    including, 4.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation and the plugin not properly
    validating a file or its path prior to deleting it in the ''wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary
    files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote
    code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
