  description: The BuddyForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization
    of untrusted input via the 'url' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.7.7.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such
    as a subscriber, to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the
    data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious
    actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker
    is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload, however, this can
    easily be achieved by uploading a fake profile photo prior to launching an attack.
