  description: 'The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing
    capability check on the upload and delete_file functions in versions up to, and
    including, 1.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    permissions, to perform an unauthorized file upload or delete files.
