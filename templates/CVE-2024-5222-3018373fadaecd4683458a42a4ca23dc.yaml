  description: "The Responsive Addons \u2013 Starter Templates, Advanced Features\
    \ and Customizer Settings for Responsive Theme. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's file uploader in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 3.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
