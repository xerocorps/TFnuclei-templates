  description: 'The Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    the UploadHandler.php file and no direct file access prevention in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.22.21. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote
    code execution possible.
