  description: 'The Kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary folder
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_font() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.21.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary folders
    on the server.
