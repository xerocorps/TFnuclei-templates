  description: 'The Stripe Payment Plugin for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.7.7. This
    is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during a Stripe
    checkout through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as
    users who have orders, who are typically customers.
