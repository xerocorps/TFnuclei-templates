  description: 'The CP Contact Form with PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.56. This is
    due to the plugin exposing an unauthenticated IPN-like endpoint (via the ''cp_contactformpp_ipncheck''
    query parameter) that processes payment confirmations without any authentication,
    nonce verification, or PayPal IPN signature validation. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to mark form submissions as paid without making
    actual payments by sending forged payment notification requests with arbitrary
    POST data (payment_status, txn_id, payer_email).
