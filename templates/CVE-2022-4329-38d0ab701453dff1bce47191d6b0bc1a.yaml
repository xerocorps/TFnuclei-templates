  description: 'The Product list Widget for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the ''formid'' parameter.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. Please note the vulnerable and patched versions
    are the same as the developer did not update the version number in the patched
    version.
