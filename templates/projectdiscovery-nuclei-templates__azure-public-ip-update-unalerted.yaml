  description: 'Ensure that activity log alerts are used to detect "Create or Update
    Public IP Address" events within your Microsoft Azure cloud account. An activity
    log alert gets activated when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert occurs.

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Create or Update
    Public IP Address" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed,
    leading to potential security risks.

  remediation: 'Ensure alert rules are properly configured to monitor and notify on
    "Create or Update Public IP Address" events by setting the alert condition to
    "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write" and ensuring that an action group
    is attached to manage notifications.
