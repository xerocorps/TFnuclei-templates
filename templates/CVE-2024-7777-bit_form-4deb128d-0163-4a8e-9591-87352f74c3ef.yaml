  description: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact
    Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and deletion due to insufficient file path
    validation in multiple functions in versions 2.0 to 2.13.9. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read
    and delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code
    execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
