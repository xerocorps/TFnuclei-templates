  description: 'The RSS Feed Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via $_SERVER[''REQUEST_URI''] in all versions up to, and
    including, 3.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
