  description: "The All In One WP Security & Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.0. This\
    \ is due to incorrect nonce validation on the functions\_'render_login_whitelist',\
    \ 'render_rename_login', 'render_honeypot' functions and possible others. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk actions on the\
    \ plugin's list tables (such as deleting blocked IP entries) via a forged request\
    \ granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as\
    \ clicking on a link.  These actions would be restricted by manipulating entries\
    \ by database ID, not by other fields (such as IP address).\n"
