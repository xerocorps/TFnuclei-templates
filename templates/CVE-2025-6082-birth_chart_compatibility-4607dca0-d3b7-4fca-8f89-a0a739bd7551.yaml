  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2025-6082
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    cvss-score: 5.3
  description: 'The Birth Chart Compatibility plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to
    insufficient protection against directly accessing the plugin''s index.php file,
    which causes an error exposing the full path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used
    to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and
    requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
