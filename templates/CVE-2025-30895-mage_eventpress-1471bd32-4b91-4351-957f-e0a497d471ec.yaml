  description: "The WpEvently plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 4.2.9. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary\
    \ files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included.\n"
