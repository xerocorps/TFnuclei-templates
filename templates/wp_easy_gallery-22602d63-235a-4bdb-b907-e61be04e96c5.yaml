  description: 'The WP Easy Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''select_gallery'' and ''galleryId'' parameters in versions
    up to, and including, 1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    that execute in a victim''s browser.
