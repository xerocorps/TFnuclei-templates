  description: 'The Event Tickets and Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to payment bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.26.5. This is due to
    the /wp-json/tribe/tickets/v1/commerce/free/order endpoint not verifying that
    a ticket type should be free allowing the user to bypass the payment. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain access to paid tickets, without
    paying for them, causing a loss of revenue for the target.
