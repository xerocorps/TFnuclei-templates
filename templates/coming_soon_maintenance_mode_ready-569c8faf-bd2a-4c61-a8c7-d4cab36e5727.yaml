  description: 'The Ready! Coming Soon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.5.0.
    This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Additionally unauthenticated
    attackers can perform actions in the plugin if they can trick an administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
