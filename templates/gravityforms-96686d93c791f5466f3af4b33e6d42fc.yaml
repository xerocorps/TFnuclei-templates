  description: WordPress Plugin Gravity Forms is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability
    because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage
    this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting
    user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal
    cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. WordPress Plugin
    Gravity Forms version 2.0.6.5 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
