  description: 'The Responsive Progress Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s rprogress shortcode in versions
    less than, or equal to, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
