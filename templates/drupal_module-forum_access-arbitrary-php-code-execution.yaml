  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module changes your forum administration page to allow you to
    set forums private. You can control what user roles can view, edit, delete, and
    post to each forum. You can also give each forum a list of users who have administrative
    access on that forum (AKA moderators). This module requires the ACL module. The
    module processes user input in a way that could be unsafe. This can lead to Remote
    Code Execution via Object Injection. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact
    that an attacker needs the administer forums permission. This Security Advisory
    is being released in coordination with SA-CONTRIB-2023-034 for the ACL module,
    on which Forum Access depends.
