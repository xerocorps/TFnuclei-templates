  description: "The Real3D Flipbook Lite \u2013 3D FlipBook, PDF Viewer, PDF Embedder\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing\
    \ file type validation in the 'r3dfb_save_thumbnail_callback' function in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on\
    \ the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
