  description: 'The Local Development plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the update_settings function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
