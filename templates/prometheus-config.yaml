  description: A Prometheus config API endpoint was discovered. The config endpoint
    returns the loaded Prometheus configuration file along with the addresses of targets
    and alerting/discovery services alongside the credentials required to access them.
    Usually, Prometheus replaces the passwords in the credentials config configuration
    field with the placeholder <secret> (although this still leaks the username).
