  description: 'The Product Enquiry for WooCommerce, WooCommerce product catalog plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and
    including, 2.2.33.32 via deserialization of untrusted input in enquiry_detail.php.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and
    above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
    software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code.
