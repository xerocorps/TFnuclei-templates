  description: 'In the Reponsive Menu (free and Pro) WordPress plugins before 4.0.4,
    subscribers could upload zip archives containing malicious PHP files that would
    get extracted to the /rmp-menu/ directory. These files could then be accessed
    via the front end of the site to trigger remote code execution and ultimately
    allow an attacker to execute commands to further infect a WordPress site.
