  description: "The exposure of the KACE Systems Management Appliance\u2019s installer\
    \ interface through the /common/setup.php endpoint allowed unauthorized access\
    \ to the system setup wizard. This interface was publicly accessible when it should\
    \ have been restricted, potentially granting attackers the ability to initiate\
    \ or manipulate the setup process, leading to system compromise or unauthorized\
    \ configuration changes.\n"
