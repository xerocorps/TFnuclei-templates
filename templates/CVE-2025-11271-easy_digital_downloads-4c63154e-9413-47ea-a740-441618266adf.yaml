  description: 'The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Order
    Manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.2 due to an order verification
    bypass. The verification is unconditionally skipped when the POST body includes
    verification_override=1. Because this value is attacker-supplied, an unauthenticated
    actor can submit a forged IPN and have it treated as verified, even on production
    sites and with verification otherwise enabled. A valid PayPal transaction id is
    needed, restricting order manipulation to orders placed by the attacker.  This,
    in turn, requires them to have a customer account.
