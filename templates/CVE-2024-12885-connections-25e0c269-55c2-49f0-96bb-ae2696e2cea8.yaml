  description: 'The Connections Business Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary directory deletion due to insufficient file path validation when
    deleting a connections image directory in all versions up to, and including, 10.4.66.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
    and above, to delete arbitrary folders on the server and all their content.
