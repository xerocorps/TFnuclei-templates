  description: 'The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters found in the ~/includes/class-menu-page.php
    file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to
    and including 2.1.1. Due to missing authorization checks on the tawcvs_save_settings
    function, low-level authenticated users such as subscribers can exploit this vulnerability.
