  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-13889
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 7.2
  description: 'The WordPress Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 0.8.3 via deserialization of untrusted
    input in the ''maybe_unserialize'' function. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object.
    No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability
    has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed
    on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete
    arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP
    chain present.
