  description: 'The FG Drupal to WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.67.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_importer() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete logs via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
