  description: "The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award\
    \ Winner \u2014 Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file\
    \ uploads due to missing file type validation in the gh_big_file_upload() function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on\
    \ the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
