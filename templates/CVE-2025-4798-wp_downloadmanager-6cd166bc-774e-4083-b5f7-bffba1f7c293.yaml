  description: 'The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file read in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This is due to a lack
    of restriction on the directory an administrator can select for storing downloads.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
    and above, to download and read any file on the server, including system and configuration
    files.
