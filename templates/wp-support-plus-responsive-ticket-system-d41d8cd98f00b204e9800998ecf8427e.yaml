  description: The WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, and including 8.0.7. This
    is due to insufficient file type validation on the wpsp_upload_attachment AJAX
    action which makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files that could be used to obtain remote code execution.
