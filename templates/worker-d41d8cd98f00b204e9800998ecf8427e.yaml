  description: The Manage WP Worker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including 4.9.2, due to the use of global keys that
    every installation of Manage WP worker uses for signature verification. This makes
    it possible to specially craft a request that can be used to auto-login as any
    user on any WordPress site running the plugin.
