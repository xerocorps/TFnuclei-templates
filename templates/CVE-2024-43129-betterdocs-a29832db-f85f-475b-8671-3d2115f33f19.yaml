  description: "The BetterDocs \u2013 Best Documentation, FAQ & Knowledge Base Plugin\
    \ with AI Support & Instant Answer for Elementor & Gutenberg plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 3.5.8 via the 'layout_template' of several blocks. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
