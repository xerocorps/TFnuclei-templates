  description: The Paid Memberships Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an open
    redirect vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due to
    missing redirect location verification on the pmpro_redirect_to_logged_in() function.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to redirect traffic to a different
    website, where they could potentially perform other attacks; such as phishing.
