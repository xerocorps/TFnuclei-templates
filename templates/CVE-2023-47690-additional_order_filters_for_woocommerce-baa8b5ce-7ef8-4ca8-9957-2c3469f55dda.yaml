  description: 'The Additional Order Filters for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the PHP_SELF in versions up
    to, and including, 1.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
