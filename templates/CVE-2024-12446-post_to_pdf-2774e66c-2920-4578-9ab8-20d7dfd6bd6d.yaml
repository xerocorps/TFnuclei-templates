  description: 'The Post to Pdf plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s ''gmptp_single_post'' shortcode in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
