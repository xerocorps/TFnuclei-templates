  description: 'The Sucuri Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.33. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several of its hooks. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to log edit/modify/delete events for themes and
    plugins, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
