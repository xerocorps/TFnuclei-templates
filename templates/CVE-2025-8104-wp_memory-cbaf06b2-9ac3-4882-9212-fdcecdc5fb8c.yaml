  description: 'The Memory Usage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.98. This is due to missing
    nonce validation in the wpmemory_install_plugin() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to silently install one of the several whitelisted
    plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
