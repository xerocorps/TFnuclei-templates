  description: 'The Video & Photo Gallery for Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3 due to
    insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation
    on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
    already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from
    the database.
