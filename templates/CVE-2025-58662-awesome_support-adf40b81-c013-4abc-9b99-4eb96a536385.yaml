  description: "The Awesome Support \u2013 WordPress HelpDesk & Support Plugin plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 6.3.5 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level access and above, to inject a\
    \ PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which\
    \ means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing\
    \ a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional\
    \ plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to\
    \ perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute\
    \ code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
