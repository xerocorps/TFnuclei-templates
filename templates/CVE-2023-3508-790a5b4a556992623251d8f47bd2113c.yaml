  description: 'The WooCommerce Pre-Orders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke these functions and perform actions such
    as email pre-order customers, change released dates, mark all pre-orders complete
    for specific products, and cancel pre-orders for products via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
