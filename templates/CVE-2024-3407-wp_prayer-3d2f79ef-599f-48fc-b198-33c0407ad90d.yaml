  description: 'The WP Prayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.9. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the wpe_manage_prayer page. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete prayers via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
