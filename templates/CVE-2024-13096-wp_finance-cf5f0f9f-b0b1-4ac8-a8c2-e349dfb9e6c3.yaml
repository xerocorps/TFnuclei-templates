  description: 'The WP Finance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the ''wpfinance'' page. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
