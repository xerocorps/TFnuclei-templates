  description: "The Madara \u2013 Responsive and modern WordPress theme for manga\
    \ sites theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 2.2.2 via the 'template' parameter. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the\
    \ server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used\
    \ to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included.\n"
