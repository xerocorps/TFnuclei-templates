  description: "The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 93.1.0\
    \ via the 'page' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included. The Local File Inclusion exploit can be chained to include various\
    \ dashboard view files in the plugin. One such chain can be leveraged to update\
    \ the password of Super Administrator accounts in Multisite environments making\
    \ privilege escalation possible. The vendor has updated the version numbers beginning\
    \ with `1.93.1 (02-07-2025)` for the patched version. This version comes after\
    \ version 93.1.0.\n"
