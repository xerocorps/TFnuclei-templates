  description: 'The OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.44. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''empty_ham_entries'' and ''empty_spam_entries''
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete both
    spam and legitimate entries via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
