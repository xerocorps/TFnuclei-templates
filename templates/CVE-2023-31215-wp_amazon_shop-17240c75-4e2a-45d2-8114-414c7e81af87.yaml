  description: 'The Dropshipping & Affiliation with Amazon plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation on files
    imported from a URL via the wpas_import_product_from_amazon() function called
    via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
