  description: 'The GEO My WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in versions up to, and including
    4.4.0.2 (or version up to 3.1 for premium). This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
