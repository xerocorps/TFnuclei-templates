  description: The Autoptimize WordPress plugin before 2.7.8 attempts to delete malicious
    files (such as .php) form the uploaded archive via the 'Import Settings' feature,
    after its extraction. However, the extracted folders are not checked and it is
    possible to upload a zip which contained a directory with PHP file in it and then
    it is not removed from the disk. It is a bypass of CVE-2020-24948 which allows
    sending a PHP file via the 'Import Settings' functionality to achieve Remote Code
    Execution.
