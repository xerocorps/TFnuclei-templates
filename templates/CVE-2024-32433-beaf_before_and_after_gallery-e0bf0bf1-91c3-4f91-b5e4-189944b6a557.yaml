    cvss-score: 4.3
  description: 'The BEAF plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.5.4. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the bafg_new_feature_notice_dismissed() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
