  description: 'The Email Newsletter, Marketing, Email Automation and CRM Plugin for
    WordPress by FluentCRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.44 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
