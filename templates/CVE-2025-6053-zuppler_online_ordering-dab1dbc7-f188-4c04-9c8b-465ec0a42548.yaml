  description: 'The Zuppler Online Ordering plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''zuppler-online-ordering-options''
    page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings
    and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
