  description: 'The K Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.9. This is due to the kleo_fb_intialize()
    function not having sufficient identity verification prior to authenticating a
    user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary
    users, granted they have access to their email.
