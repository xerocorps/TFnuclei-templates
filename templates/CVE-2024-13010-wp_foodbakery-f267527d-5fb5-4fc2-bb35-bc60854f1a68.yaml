  description: 'The WP Foodbakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.8 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping on the ''search_type'' parameter. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
