  description: 'The Newsletter, SMTP, Email marketing and Subscribe forms by Brevo
    (formely Sendinblue) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.87. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the Init() function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to log out of a Brevo connection via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
