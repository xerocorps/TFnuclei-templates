  description: 'The Login/Signup Popup, Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier
    ), and Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax) WordPress plugins by XootiX are vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery via the save_settings function found in the ~/includes/xoo-framework/admin/class-xoo-admin-settings.php
    file which makes it possible for attackers to update arbitrary options on a site
    that can be used to create an administrative user account and grant full privileged
    access to a compromised site. This affects versions <= 2.2 in Login/Signup Popup,
    versions <= 2.5.1 in Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ), and versions
    <= 2.0 in Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax).
