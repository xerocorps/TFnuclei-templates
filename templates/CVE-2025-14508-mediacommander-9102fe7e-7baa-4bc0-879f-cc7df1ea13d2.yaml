  description: "The MediaCommander \u2013 Bring Folders to Media, Posts, and Pages\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data deletion due to a missing\
    \ capability check on the import-csv REST API endpoint in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 2.3.1. This is due to the endpoint using `upload_files` capability\
    \ check (Author level) for a destructive operation that can delete all folders.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access\
    \ and above, to delete all folder organization data created by Administrators\
    \ and other users.\n"
