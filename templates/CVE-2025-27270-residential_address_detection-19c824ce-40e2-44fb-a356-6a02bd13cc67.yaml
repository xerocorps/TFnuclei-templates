  description: 'The Residential Address Detection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due
    to a missing capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including,
    2.5.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary
    options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role
    for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to
    gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
