  description: 'The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Arbitrary File Reads in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5
    via the get_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive
    information. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default
    configurations where the the default password is left as 1:1, or where the attacker
    gains access to the credentials.
