  description: 'The LearnDash LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct
    Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.6.0. This is due to the
    plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization
    and access system resources. This makes it possible for attackers with with existing
    account access at any level, to change user passwords and potentially take over
    administrator accounts.
