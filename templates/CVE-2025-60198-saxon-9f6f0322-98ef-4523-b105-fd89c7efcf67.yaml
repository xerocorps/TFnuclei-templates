  description: 'The Saxon - Viral Content Blog & Magazine Marketing WordPress theme
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including,
    1.9.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute
    arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those
    files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
    code execution in cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded
    and included.
