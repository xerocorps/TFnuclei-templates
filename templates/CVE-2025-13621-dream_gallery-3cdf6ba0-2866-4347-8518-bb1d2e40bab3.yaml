    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''dreampluginsmain'' AJAX action. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings and
    inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
