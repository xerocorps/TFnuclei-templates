  description: 'The Affiliate Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''affiplus_settings'' page. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
