  description: "The Picture Gallery \u2013 Frontend Image Uploads, AJAX Photo List\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's\
    \ videowhisper_picture_upload_guest shortcode in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.5.22 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
