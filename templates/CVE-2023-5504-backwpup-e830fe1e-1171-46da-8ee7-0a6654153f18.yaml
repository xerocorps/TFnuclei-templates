  description: 'The BackWPup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal
    in versions up to, and including, 4.0.1 via the Log File Folder. This allows authenticated
    attackers to store backups in arbitrary folders on the server provided they can
    be written to by the server. Additionally, default settings will place an index.php
    and a .htaccess file into the chosen directory (unless already present) when the
    first backup job is run that are intended to prevent directory listing and file
    access. This means that an attacker could set the backup directory to the root
    of another site in a shared environment and thus disable that site.
