  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar \u2014 Simply Schedule Appointments\
    \ Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.8.5. This is due to the software allowing\
    \ users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running\
    \ do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute\
    \ arbitrary shortcodes.\n"
