  description: 'The WHMpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 6.2-revision-5 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
