  description: 'The Wp EMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 10.6.5. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the emember_payments page. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to bulk delete payments via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
