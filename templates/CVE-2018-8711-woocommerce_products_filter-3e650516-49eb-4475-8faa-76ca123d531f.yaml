  description: 'A local file inclusion issue was discovered in the WooCommerce Products
    Filter (aka WOOF) plugin before 1.2.0 for WordPress, as demonstrated by the shortcode
    parameter in a woof_redraw_woof action. The vulnerability is due to the lack of
    args/input validation on render_html before allowing it to be called by extract(),
    a PHP built-in function. Because of this, the supplied args/input can be used
    to overwrite the $pagepath variable, which then could lead to a local file inclusion
    attack.
