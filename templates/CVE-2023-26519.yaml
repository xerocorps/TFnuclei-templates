  description: The Publish to Schedule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.5.4 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with administrator-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
