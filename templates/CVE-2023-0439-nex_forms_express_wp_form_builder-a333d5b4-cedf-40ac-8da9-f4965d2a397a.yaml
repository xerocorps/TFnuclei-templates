  description: 'The NEX-Forms - Ultimate Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form names parameter in versions up to, and
    including, 8.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level access
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. The plugin has the option to allow lower-level users access
    to the form, which may make this issue exploitable by lower-privileged users in
    some instances.
