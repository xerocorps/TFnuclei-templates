  description: 'The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in the delete_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the
    server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is
    deleted (such as wp-config.php). This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers
    in default configurations where the the default password is left as 1:1, or where
    the attacker gains access to the credentials.
