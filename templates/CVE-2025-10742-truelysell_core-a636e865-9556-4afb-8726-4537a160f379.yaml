  description: 'The Truelysell Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This is due to the
    plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization
    and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note:
    This can only be exploited unauthenticated if the attacker knows which page contains
    the ''truelysell_edit_staff'' shortcode.
