    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Cost Calculator Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the deleteOrdersFiles()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.3. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary file paths into the orders that
    are removed, when an administrator deletes them. This can lead to remote code
    execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability
    requires the Cost Calculator Builder Pro version to be installed along with the
    free version in order to be exploitable.
