  description: 'The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization
    of untrusted input via the ''images_array'' parameter in versions up to, and including
    2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges
    to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP
    Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP
    chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading
    a file with the serialized payload.
