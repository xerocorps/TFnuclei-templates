  description: "The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to unauthorized setting changes by unauthenticated users in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.0.9.6. This is due to insufficient validation of settings on\
    \ the 'tp_translation' AJAX action which makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to bypass any restrictions and influence the data shown on the site.\
    \ Please note this is a separate issue from CVE-2022-2461. \nNotes from the researcher:\
    \ When installed Transposh comes with a set of pre-configured options, one of\
    \ these is the \"Who can translate\" setting under the \"Settings\" tab. However,\
    \ this option is largely ignored, if Transposh has enabled its \"autotranslate\"\
    \ feature (it's enabled by default) and the HTTP POST parameter \"sr0\" is larger\
    \ than 0. This is caused by a faulty validation in \"wp/transposh_db.php.\"\n"
