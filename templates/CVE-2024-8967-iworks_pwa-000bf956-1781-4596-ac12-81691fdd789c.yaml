  description: "The PWA \u2014 easy way to Progressive Web App plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses the SVG file.\n"
