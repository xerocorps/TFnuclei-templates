  description: 'The Reset plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the reset_db_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to reset several tables in the database like comments, themes, plugins,
    and more via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
