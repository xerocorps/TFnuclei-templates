  description: 'The Redirect Redirection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the addRedirect function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to add redirects, via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
