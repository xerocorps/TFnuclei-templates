  description: 'H-Sphere is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
    because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. An attacker may
    leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting
    user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal
    cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.
