  description: 'The Project Honey Pot Spam Trap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the printAdminPage() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject
    malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
