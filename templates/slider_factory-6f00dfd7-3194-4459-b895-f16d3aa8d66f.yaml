  description: 'The Responsive Image Slider, Photo Gallery And Carousel plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 1.3.2.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the sf_clone_slider, sf_save_slider,
    and sf_remove_slider functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to clone, save and/or remove sliders via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
