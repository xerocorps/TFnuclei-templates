  description: 'The 3D Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''des[]'' parameter in all versions up to, and including,
    1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
