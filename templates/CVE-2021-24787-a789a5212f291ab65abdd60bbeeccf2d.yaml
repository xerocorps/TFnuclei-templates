  description: 'The Client Invoicing by Sprout Invoices plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.5 due to the
    plugin not sanitising and escaping some of its settings. This makes it possible
    for high privilege users to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages to perform attacks
    even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.
