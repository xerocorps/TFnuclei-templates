  description: "The Interactive Contact Form and Multi Step Form Builder with Drag\
    \ & Drop Editor \u2013 Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.5.1 via deserialization\
    \ of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain\
    \ is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional\
    \ plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker\
    \ to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.\n"
