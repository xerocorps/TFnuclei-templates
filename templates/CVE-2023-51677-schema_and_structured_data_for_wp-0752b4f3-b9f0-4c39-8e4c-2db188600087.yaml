  description: 'The Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.23
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
