    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 9.8
  description: 'The CiyaShop - Multipurpose WooCommerce Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.19.0
    via deserialization of untrusted input in the ''add_ciyashop_wishlist'' and ''ciyashop_get_compare''
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP
    Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means
    this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP
    chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin
    or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
    actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code
    depending on the POP chain present.
