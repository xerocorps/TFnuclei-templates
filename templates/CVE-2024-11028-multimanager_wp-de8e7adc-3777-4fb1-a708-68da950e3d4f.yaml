  description: "The MultiManager WP \u2013 Manage All Your WordPress Sites Easily\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately\
    \ determining the current user via user-supplied input. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link that will allow\
    \ them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user\
    \ impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch\
    \ in version 1.1.2.\n"
