  description: "The WooODT Lite \u2013 Delivery & pickup date time location for WooCommerce\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due the /inc/bycwooodt_get_all_orders.php\
    \ file being publicly accessible and generating a publicly visible error message.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path\
    \ of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information\
    \ displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be\
    \ present for damage to an affected website.\n"
