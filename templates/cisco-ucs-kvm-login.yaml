  description: The KVM console is an interface accessible from the Cisco UCS Manager
    GUI or the KVM Launch Manager that emulates a direct KVM connection. Unlike the
    KVM dongle, which requires you to be physically connected to the server, the KVM
    console allows you to connect to the server from a remote location across the
    network.
