  description: 'The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
    5.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to (1) performing a post-booking auto-login or (2) updating their profile details
    (e.g. password). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to (1) login
    as an arbitrary user if their email address is known or (2) change an arbitrary
    user''s password, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to
    their account.
