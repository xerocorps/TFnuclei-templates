  description: 'The Quiz and Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing filename sanitization in the qsm_upload_image_fd_question()
    function in versions up to, and including, 7.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server using a double
    extension attack method which may make remote code execution possible on sites
    with a configuration that parse the first extension of a file.

    This is due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2020-35949.'
