  description: 'The Mang Board WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the board_header and board_footer parameters in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.8.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
