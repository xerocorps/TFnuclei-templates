  description: "The Buzz Club \u2013 Night Club, DJ and Music Festival Event WordPress\
    \ Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data\
    \ that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the\
    \ 'cmsmasters_hide_admin_notice' function in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level\
    \ access and above, to update option values to 'hide' on the WordPress site. This\
    \ can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site\
    \ and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such\
    \ as registration.\n"
