  description: "The Nextend Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to a self-based Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018error_description\u2019\
    \ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.12 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers, with access to a subscriber-level account, to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: This vulnerability can be successfully\
    \ exploited on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an OAuth pre-authenticated\
    \ higher-level user (e.g., administrator) by leveraging a cross-site request forgery\
    \ in conjunction with a certain social engineering technique to achieve a critical\
    \ impact scenario (cross-site scripting to administrator-level account creation).\
    \ However, successful exploitation requires \"Debug mode\" to be enabled in the\
    \ plugin's \"Global Settings\".\n"
