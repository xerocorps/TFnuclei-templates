  description: The WP LESS to CSS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with administrative level permissions and above to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
