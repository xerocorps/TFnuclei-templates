  description: 'The Professional Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the watch_for_contact_form_submit
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger test
    email sending via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
