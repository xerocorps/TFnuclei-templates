  description: 'The WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to to arbitrary file read due to insufficient file path validation during the
    comments import process, in versions up to, and including, 2.3.7. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to read
    the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
    The issue was partially fixed in version 2.3.8 and fully fixed in 2.3.9
