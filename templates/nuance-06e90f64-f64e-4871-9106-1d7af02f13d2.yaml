  description: 'The Nuance theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the ''VALUMS_UPLOADER_PATH/php. php'' file
    in versions up to, and including, 1.2 (potentially in later versions if available).
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
