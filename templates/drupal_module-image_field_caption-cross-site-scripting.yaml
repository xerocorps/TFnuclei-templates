  author: Bishopfox
  description: Image Field Caption (image_field_caption) adds an extra text area for
    captions on image fields. The module doesnt sanitize user input in certain cases,
    which leads to a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is
    mitigated by several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only assigned
    to either editors, site builders or administrators.
