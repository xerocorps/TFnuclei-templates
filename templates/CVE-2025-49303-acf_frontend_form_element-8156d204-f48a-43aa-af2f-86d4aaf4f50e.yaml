  description: 'The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions
    up to, and including, 3.28.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Editor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which
    can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such
    as wp-config.php).
