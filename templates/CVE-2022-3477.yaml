  description: The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized
    Account Access and Privilege Escalation  in versions up to, but not including,
    3.5 due to improper implementation of the Facebook login feature. This allows
    unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user as long as they know the user's
    email address. This plugin is used in several themes such as Newspaper and Newsmag.
