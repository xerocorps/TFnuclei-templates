  description: 'The Paid Member Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.10.4. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_add_log_entry function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify log entries via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
