  description: 'The Dokan Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.5. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    password during a staff password reset. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with vendor-level access and above, to elevate their privilege to the
    level of a staff member and then change arbitrary user passwords, including those
    of administrators in order to gain access to their accounts. By default, the plugin
    allows customers to become vendors.
