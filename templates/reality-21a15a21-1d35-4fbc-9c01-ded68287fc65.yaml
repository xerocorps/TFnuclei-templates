  description: 'The Reality theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on the ''keyword'' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
