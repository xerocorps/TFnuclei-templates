  description: 'The SSH key exchange algorithm is fundamental to keep the protocol
    secure. It is what allows two previously unknown parties to generate a shared
    key in plain sight, and have that secret remain private to the client and server.
    Over time, some implementations of this algorithm have been identified as weak
    or vulnerable.
