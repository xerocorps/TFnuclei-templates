  description: 'The Responsive Food and Drink Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s display_pdf_menus shortcode in
    all versions up to, and including, 2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
