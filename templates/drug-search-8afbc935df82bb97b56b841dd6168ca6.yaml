  description: 'The Zebra_Form library present in the WP Inimat, Ad Swapper, Drug
    Search, Teaser Maker, and Customer Service Software & Support Ticket System Plugins
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ''form''
    and ''control'' parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.9.8 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
