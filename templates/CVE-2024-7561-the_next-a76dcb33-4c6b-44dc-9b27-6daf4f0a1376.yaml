  description: 'The The Next theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input
    from the wpeden_post_meta post meta value. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No
    known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present
    via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow
    the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
