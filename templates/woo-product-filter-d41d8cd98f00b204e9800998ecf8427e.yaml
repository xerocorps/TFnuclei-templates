  description: The Product Filter by WooBeWoo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authorization bypass in versions up to, and including 1.4.9 due to missing authorization
    checks on various functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to perform unauthorized actions such as creating new filters and injecting malicious
    javascript into a vulnerable site. This was actively exploited at the time of
    discovery.
