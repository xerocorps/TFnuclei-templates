  description: 'The Motors theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.67. This is due
    to the theme not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary
    user passwords, including those of administrators, and leverage that to gain access
    to their account.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can change arbitrary user passwords including
    administrators through insufficient identity validation, enabling complete site
    takeover and unauthorized access to all accounts.
