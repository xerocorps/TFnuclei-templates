  description: "The Reviews and Rating \u2013 Google My Business plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on several\
    \ functions in versions up to, and including, 4.14. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to modify\
    \ restricted data and perform actions intended only for administrators like clearing\
    \ cache, resetting reviews, and more.\n"
