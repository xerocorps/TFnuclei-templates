  description: 'The File Away plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to a missing capability check and missing file type validation in
    the upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.9.0.1. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
