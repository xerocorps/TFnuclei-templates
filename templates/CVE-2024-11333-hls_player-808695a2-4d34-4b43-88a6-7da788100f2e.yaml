  description: 'The HLS Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s ''hls_player'' shortcode in all versions up to, and
    including, 1.0.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
    user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
