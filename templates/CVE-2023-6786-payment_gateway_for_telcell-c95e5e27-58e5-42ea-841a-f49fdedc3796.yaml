  description: 'The Payment Gateway for Telcell plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This is due to insufficient
    validation on the redirect url supplied via the ''api_url'' parameter. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious
    sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
