  description: "The Smart Forms \u2013 when you need more than just a contact form\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin\
    \ settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.98 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts\
    \ in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only\
    \ affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has\
    \ been disabled.\n"
