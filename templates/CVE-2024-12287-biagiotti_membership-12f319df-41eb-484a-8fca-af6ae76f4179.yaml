  description: 'The Biagiotti Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin
    not properly verifying a user''s identity prior to authenticating them. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators,
    granted they have access to an email.
