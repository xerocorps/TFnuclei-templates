  description: 'The Icons Factory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Deletion due to insufficient authorization and improper path validation within
    the delete_files() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.12. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to delete arbitrary files on
    the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file
    is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
