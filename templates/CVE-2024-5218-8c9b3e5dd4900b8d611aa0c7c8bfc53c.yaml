  description: "The Reviews and Rating \u2013 Google Reviews plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's file upload feature\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
