  description: "The GeoDirectory \u2013 WP Business Directory Plugin and Classified\
    \ Listings Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the plugin's 'gd_best_of' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.8.119 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
