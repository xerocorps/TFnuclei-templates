  description: 'The Plug your WooCommerce into the largest catalog of customized print
    products from Helloprint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code
    execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
