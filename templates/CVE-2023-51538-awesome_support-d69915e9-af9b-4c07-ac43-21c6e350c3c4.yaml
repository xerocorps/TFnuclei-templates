  description: 'The Awesome Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.1.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the wpas_get_ticket_replies_ajax and ajax_delete_attachment
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the
    retrieval of ticket replies and delete attachments via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
