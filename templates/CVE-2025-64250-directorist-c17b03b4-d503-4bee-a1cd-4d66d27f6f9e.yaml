  description: 'The Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified
    Ads Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions
    up to, and including, 8.5.6. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect
    url supplied. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect
    users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into
    performing an action.
