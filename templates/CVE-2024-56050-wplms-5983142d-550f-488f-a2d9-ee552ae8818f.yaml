  description: 'The WPLMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in all versions up to 1.9.9.5.3 (exclusive).
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
    and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible.
