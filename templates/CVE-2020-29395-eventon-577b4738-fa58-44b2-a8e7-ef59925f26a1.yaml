  description: 'The EventON plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.0.5. This is due to insufficient
    escaping and sanitization on the q= parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note
    this only affects the premium version of this plugin.
