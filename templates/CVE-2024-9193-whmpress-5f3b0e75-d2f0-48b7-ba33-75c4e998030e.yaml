  description: "The WHMpress - WHMCS WordPress Integration Plugin plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 6.3-revision-0 via the whmpress_domain_search_ajax_extended_results() function.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute\
    \ arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those\
    \ files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or\
    \ achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file\
    \ types can be uploaded and included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. Utilizing the /admin/services.php\
    \ file, this can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator\
    \ and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access\
    \ to a vulnerable site.\n"
