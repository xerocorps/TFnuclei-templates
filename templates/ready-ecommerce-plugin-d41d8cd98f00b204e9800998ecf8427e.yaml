  description: 'The Ready! Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 0.5.1.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make unauthorized AJAX calls
    to perform arbitrary actions via forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
