  description: "The InstaWP Connect \u2013 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 0.1.0.85 via the 'instawp-database-manager' parameter. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the\
    \ server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used\
    \ to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where php file types can be uploaded and included, or are already present\
    \ on the filesystem locally. There are currently no known vulnerabilities in this\
    \ plugin that make file upload possible, meaning this won't be exploitable to\
    \ achieve remote code execution on most instances with just this plugin alone.\
    \ Another vulnerability would need to be present on the site allowing arbitrary\
    \ file upload in order to leverage this to achieve remote code execution.\n"
