  description: "The 404 to 301 \u2013 Redirect, Log and Notify 404 Errors plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of\
    \ add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in versions up to, and\
    \ including, 3.1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a\
    \ user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is only exploitable\
    \ if the plugin has been installed for a week and the review notice has not been\
    \ dismissed.\n"
