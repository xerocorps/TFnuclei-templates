  description: 'The Booking and Rental Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including,
    1.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
