  description: 'The Carousel Anything For WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
