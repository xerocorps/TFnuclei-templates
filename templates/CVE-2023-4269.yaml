  description: 'The User Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive
    Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4 via the ual_export_log()
    function that is missing a capability check. This can allow unauthenticated attackers
    to extract sensitive data including user roles, usernames, and IP Addresses. This
    issue was partially patched in 1.6.4, which made it only exploitable by authenticated
    users, and a full patch was released in 1.6.6.
