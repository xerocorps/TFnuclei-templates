  description: 'The RS-Members plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin not properly
    restricting what roles a user can be assigned to. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges
    to that of an administrator.
