  description: "The MinimogWP \u2013 The High Converting eCommerce WordPress Theme\
    \ theme for WordPress is vulnerable to price manipulation in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 3.9.0. This is due to an insufficient check on quantity values\
    \ when changing quantities in the cart. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to add items to the cart and adjust the quantity to a fractional amount,\
    \ causing the price to change based on the fractional amount. The vulnerability\
    \ cannot be exploited if WooCommerce version 9.8.2+ is installed.\n"
