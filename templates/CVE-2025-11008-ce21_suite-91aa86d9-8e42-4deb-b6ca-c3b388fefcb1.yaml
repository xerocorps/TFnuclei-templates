  description: 'The CE21 Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information
    Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1 via the log file. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including
    authentication credentials, which can be used to log in as other users as long
    as they have used the plugin''s custom authentication feature before. This may
    include administrators, which makes a complete site takeover possible.
