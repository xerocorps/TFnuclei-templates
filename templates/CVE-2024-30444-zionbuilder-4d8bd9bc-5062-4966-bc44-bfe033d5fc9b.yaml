  description: "The WordPress Page Builder \u2013 Zion Builder plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.6.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
