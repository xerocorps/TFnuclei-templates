  description: "The Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.12.4.\
    \ This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions hooked via AJAX\
    \ in the ~/includes/class-ecwid-admin-storefront-page.php. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to modify several of the plugin's settings via\
    \ a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link. \tCVE-2023-6292 may be a duplicate of\
    \ this issue.\n"
