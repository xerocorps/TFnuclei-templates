  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions, via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
