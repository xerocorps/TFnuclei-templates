  description: 'The Real Estate 7 WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation via the ''template-submit-listing.php''
    file in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Seller-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible if front-end
    listing submission has been enabled.
