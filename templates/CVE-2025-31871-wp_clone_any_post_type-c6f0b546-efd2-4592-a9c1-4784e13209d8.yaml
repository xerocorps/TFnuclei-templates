  description: 'The WP Clone any post type plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open
    Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 3.5. This is due to insufficient
    validation on a redirect url. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick
    them into performing an action.
