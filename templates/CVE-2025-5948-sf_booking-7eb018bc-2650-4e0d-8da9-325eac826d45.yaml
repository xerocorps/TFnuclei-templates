  description: 'The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
    6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to claiming a business when using the claim_business AJAX action. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user including admins.
    Please note that subscriber privileges or brute-forcing are needed when completing
    the business takeover. The claim_id is needed to takeover the admin account, but
    brute-forcing is a practical approach to obtaining valid IDs.
