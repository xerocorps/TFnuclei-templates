  description: 'The Time Tracker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the ''tt_update_table_function''
    and ''tt_delete_record_function'' functions in all versions up to, and including,
    3.1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to update options such as user registration and default role,
    allowing anyone to register as an Administrator, and to delete limited data from
    the database.
