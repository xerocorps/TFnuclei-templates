  description: "The FAQ And Answers \u2013 Create Frequently Asked Questions Area\
    \ on WP Sites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the plugin's 'faq' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
