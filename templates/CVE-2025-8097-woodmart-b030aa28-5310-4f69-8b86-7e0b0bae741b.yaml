  description: 'The WoodMart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Input Validation
    in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.6. This is due to insufficient validation
    of the qty parameter in the woodmart_update_cart_item function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate cart quantities using fractional
    values, allowing them to obtain products for free by setting extremely small quantities
    (e.g., 0.00001) that round cart totals to $0.00, effectively bypassing payment
    requirements and allowing unauthorized acquisition of virtual or downloadable
    products.
