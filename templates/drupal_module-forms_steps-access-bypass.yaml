  description: Forms Steps provides an UI to create form workflows using form modes.
    It creates quick and configurable multisteps forms. The module doesnt sufficiently
    check user permissions to access its workflows entities that allows to see any
    entities that have been created through the different steps of its multistep forms.
    This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that you have to know the Forms Steps
    URL to create a content linked to the flow. Also, all created content is very
    hard to edit through the same flow as you have to know the URL and the linked
    hash to the content.
