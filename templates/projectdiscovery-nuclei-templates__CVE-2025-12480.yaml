  description: 'The Gladinet Triofox solution before 12.91.1126.65588 and CentreStack
    before 12.10.595.65696 allow unauthenticated access to the /management/admindatabase.aspx
    endpoint, exposing sensitive database management functionality to anyone with
    network access. An unauthenticated attacker can remotely access, view, and potentially
    interact with the database management interface, risking data disclosure or system
    compromise.

    '
  impact: 'Attackers may gain access to sensitive administrative functions of the
    Triofox database, resulting in unauthorized data access, modification, or potential
    system compromise.
