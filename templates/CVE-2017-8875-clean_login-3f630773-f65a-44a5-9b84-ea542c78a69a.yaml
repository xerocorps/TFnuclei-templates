    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Clean Login for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.10.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the clean_login_options() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. Note this vulnerability was not patched in version 1.8 as
    stated in the CVE record.
