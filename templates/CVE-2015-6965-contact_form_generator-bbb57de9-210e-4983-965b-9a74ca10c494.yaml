  description: 'The Contact Form Generator : Creative form builder for WordPress for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    2.1.86. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on cfg_forms page.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify and create contact
    form fields, create and delete forms, create and modify templates, and inject
    Cross-Site Scripting payloads via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
