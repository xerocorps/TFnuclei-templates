  description: 'The WP Fast Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to the ''wp_fast_cache_bulk_action_url''
    variable not being sanitized or escapes. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions and perform
    subsequent Cross-Site Scripting attacks via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
