  description: 'Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
    Versions 8.2.1 and below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted
    LUA script to read out-of-bound data or crash the server and subsequent denial
    of service. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting. This
    issue is fixed in version 8.2.2. To workaround this issue without patching the
    redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can
    be done using ACL to block a script by restricting both the EVAL and FUNCTION
    command families.

    '
  impact: 'Authenticated attackers can use specially crafted Lua scripts to read out-of-bound
    data or crash the Redis server, causing denial of service.
