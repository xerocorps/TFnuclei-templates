  description: 'The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''admin_page_display'' function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or change plugin settings,
    import demo data, modify or delete Directory Kit related posts and terms via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. Partial patches were made avilable in versions
    1.2.0 and 1.2.1 but the issue was not fully patched until 1.2.2
