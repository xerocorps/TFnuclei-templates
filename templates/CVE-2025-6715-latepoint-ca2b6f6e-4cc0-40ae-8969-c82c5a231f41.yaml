  description: "The LatePoint \u2013 Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and\
    \ Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.1.93 via the 'layout' parameter. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary .php files on\
    \ the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
