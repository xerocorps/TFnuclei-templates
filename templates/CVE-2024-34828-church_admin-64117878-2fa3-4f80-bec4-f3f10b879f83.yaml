  description: 'The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.32. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the includes/functions.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several
    unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
