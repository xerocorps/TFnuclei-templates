  description: 'The Image Shadow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including,
    1.1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead
    to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
