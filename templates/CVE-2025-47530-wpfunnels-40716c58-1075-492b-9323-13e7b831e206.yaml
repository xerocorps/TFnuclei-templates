  description: 'The WPFunnels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 3.5.18 via deserialization of untrusted input.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No
    known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present
    via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow
    the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
