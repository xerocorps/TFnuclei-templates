  description: 'The Garden Gnome Package plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the functionality that automatically
    extracts ''ggpkg'' files that have been uploaded in all versions up to, and including,
    2.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access
    and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible.
