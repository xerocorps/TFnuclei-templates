  description: 'The Beebee Mini plugin for WordPress uses Advanced Custom Fields which
    has a file upload vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 5.12.2. This
    makes it possible for users without the upload_files capability, such as contributors,
    or unauthenticated users in cases where a frontend form is added to the site,
    to upload allowed file types. The upload is handled by WordPress so file type
    and extension checks still occur, though this could potentially be used by high-privileged
    users in certain locked-down configurations to bypass other security mechanisms
    and upload dangerous file types. This affects versions up to 1.2.0 in the Beebee
    Mini plugin.
