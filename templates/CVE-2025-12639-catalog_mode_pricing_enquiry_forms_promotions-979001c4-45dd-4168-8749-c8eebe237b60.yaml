  description: "The wModes \u2013 Catalog Mode, Product Pricing, Enquiry Forms & Promotions\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.2.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that\
    \ a user is authorized to access sensitive information via the AJAX endpoint.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access\
    \ and above, to extract sensitive information including user emails, usernames,\
    \ roles, capabilities, and WooCommerce data such as products and payment methods.\n"
