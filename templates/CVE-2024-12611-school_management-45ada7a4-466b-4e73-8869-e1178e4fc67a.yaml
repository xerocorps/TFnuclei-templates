  description: 'The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ''title'' parameter in all
    versions up to, and including, 93.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
