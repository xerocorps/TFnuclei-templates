  description: 'The Sunshine Photo Cart: Free Client Photo Galleries for Photographers
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up
    to, and including, 3.1.1 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
    is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
    delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
