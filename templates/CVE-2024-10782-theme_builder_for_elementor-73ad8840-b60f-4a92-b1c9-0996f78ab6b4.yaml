  description: 'The Theme Builder For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 via the ''elementor-template''
    shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and
    above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they
    should not have access to.
