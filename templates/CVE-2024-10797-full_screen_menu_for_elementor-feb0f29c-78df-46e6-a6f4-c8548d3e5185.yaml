  description: 'The Full Screen Menu for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 via the  Full
    Screen Menu Elementor Widget due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can
    be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created with Elementor
    that they should not have access to.
