  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module enables you to add groups to other groups in a tree structure
    where access can be inherited up or down the tree. When you configure Subgroup
    to have a tree with at least three levels, users may inadvertently get permissions
    in a group that is an uncle or cousin of the source group, rather than a direct
    ancestor or descendant. Trees with only multiple nodes at the lowest tier (or
    nowhere) are unaffected.
