  description: 'In Unix-like operating systems, the nice command is used to execute
    a program with a modified scheduling priority. It allows users to start a process
    with a specified priority level, which can influence the allocation of CPU resources.
    This can be useful for managing system resources and controlling the impact of
    a process on system performance.
