  description: 'The Book a Room plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''bookaroom_Settings'' page. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
