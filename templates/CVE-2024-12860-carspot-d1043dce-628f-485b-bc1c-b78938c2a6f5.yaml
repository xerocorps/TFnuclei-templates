  description: "The CarSpot \u2013 Dealership Wordpress Classified Theme theme for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to the plugin not properly\
    \ validating a token prior to updating a user's password. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including\
    \ administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.\n"
