  description: 'The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 67.7.0
    via the ''MJ_gmgt_gmgt_add_user'' function due to missing validation on a user
    controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to change the email, password, and other details of any user,
    including Administrator users.
