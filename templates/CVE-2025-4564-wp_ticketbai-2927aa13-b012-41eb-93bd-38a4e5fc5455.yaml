  description: 'The TicketBAI Facturas para WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation via the ''delpdf''
    action in all versions up to, and including, 3.18. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily
    lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
