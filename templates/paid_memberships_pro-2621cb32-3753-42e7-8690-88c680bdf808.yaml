  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the edit order page in versions up to, and including,
    2.5.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
