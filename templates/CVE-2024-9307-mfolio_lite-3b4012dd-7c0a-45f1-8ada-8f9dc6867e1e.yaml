  description: 'The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads
    due to a missing capability check in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain access
    to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the
    .exe file.
