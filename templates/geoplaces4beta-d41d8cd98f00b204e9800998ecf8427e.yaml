  description: The GeoPlaces 4 Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via the /monetize/upload/ directory
    in versions up to, and including, 4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
