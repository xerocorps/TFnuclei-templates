  description: 'Ensure that Accelerated Networking feature is enabled for your Azure
    virtual machines (VMs) in order to provide low latency and high throughput for
    the network interfaces (NICs) attached to the VMs. Accelerated networking enables
    single root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) for virtual machines, vastly
    improving its networking performance. This high-performance pathway bypasses the
    host from the datapath, reducing latency, jitter and CPU utilization, so it can
    be used with the most demanding network workloads that can be installed on the
    supported VM types.

    '
  impact: 'Disabling Accelerated Networking may result in higher latency and lower
    throughput on network interfaces attached to VMs, leading to potential performance
    bottlenecks.

  remediation: 'Enable Accelerated Networking on all compatible Azure VMs to ensure
    optimal network performance. This can be done through the Azure portal or using
    Azure CLI commands.
