  description: "The All in One SEO \u2013 Powerful SEO Plugin to Boost SEO Rankings\
    \ & Increase Traffic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary\
    \ media attachment deletion due to a missing authorization check in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 4.8.9. This is due to the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/aioseo/v1/ai/image-generator`\
    \ only verifying that users have the `edit_posts` capability (Contributors and\
    \ above) without checking if they own or have permission to delete the specific\
    \ media attachments. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Contributor-level access and above, to permanently delete arbitrary media attachments\
    \ by ID via the REST API, granted they can determine valid attachment IDs.\n"
