  description: 'The SmartMag theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to, and including, 10.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary
    files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
    can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
    execution in cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and
    included.
