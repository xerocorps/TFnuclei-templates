  description: 'The Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the export download functionality.

    of an administrator, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
