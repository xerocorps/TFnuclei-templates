  description: "The Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form\
    \ Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to\
    \ insufficient file path validation in the 'entry_delete_upload_files' function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.44.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to include arbitrary file paths in a form submission. The file will\
    \ be deleted when the form submission is deleted, whether by an Administrator\
    \ or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings. This can easily lead to\
    \ remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
