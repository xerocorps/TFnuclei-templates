  description: 'The Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking with Visual Seat Plan
    and ultimate Calendar Scheduling plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the make_staff() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.21. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to grant users staff permissions. CVE-2024-37427 is likely a duplicate
    of this issue.
