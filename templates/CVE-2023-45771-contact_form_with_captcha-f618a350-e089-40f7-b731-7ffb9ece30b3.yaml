  description: 'The Contact Form With Captcha plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.8. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. The exact impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
