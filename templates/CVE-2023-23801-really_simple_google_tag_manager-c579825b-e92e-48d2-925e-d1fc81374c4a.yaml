  description: 'The Really Simple Google Tag Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_activation() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins, via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
