  description: 'The E-xact | Hosted Payment | plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the downloadBackup.php
    file function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
    easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
