  description: 'The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthenticated API key disclosure in versions up to, and including, 9.0.34
    due to the plugin adding the API key to several plugin files. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the developer''s Google API key. While
    this does not affect the security of sites using this plugin, it allows unauthenticated
    attackers to make requests using this API key with the potential of exhausting
    requests resulting in an inability to use the map functionality offered by the
    plugin.
