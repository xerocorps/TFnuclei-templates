  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file read due to missing restrictions to proper file paths in one of its AJAX
    actions in versions 2.6.10-2.8.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level access and higher, to read arbitrary files on the affected
    sites server leading to information disclosure.
