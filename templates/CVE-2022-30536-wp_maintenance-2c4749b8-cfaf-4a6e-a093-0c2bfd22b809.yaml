  description: 'The WP Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 6.0.7 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative
    permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s
    browser. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
