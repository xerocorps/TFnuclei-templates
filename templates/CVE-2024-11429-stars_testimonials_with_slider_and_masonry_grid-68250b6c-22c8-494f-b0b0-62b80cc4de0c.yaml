    \ File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 via the 'stars-testimonials-with-slider-and-masonry-grid'\
    \ shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server,\
    \ allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass\
    \ access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where\
    \ PHP files can be uploaded and included.\n"
