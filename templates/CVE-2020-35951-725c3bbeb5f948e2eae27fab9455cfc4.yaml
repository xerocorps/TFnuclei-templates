  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin before
    7.0.1 for WordPress. It allows users to delete arbitrary files such as wp-config.php
    file, which could effectively take a site offline and allow an attacker to reinstall
    with a WordPress instance under their control. This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question,
    which allowed unauthenticated deletions (even though it was only intended for
    a person to delete their own quiz-answer files).
