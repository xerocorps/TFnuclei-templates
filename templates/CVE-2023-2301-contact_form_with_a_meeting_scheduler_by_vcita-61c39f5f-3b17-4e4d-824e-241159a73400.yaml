  description: 'The Contact Form Builder by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.10.3. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on the ls_parse_vcita_callback function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings
    and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While
    the Cross-Site Scripting issue was patched in version 4.10.1, the plugin is still
    technically vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery since a capability check
    but no nonce check was added in 4.10.2.
