  description: 'The IndieAuth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.4. This is due to missing nonce
    verification on the `login_form_indieauth()` function and the authorization endpoint
    at wp-login.php?action=indieauth. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to force authenticated users to approve OAuth authorization requests for attacker-controlled
    applications via a forged request granted they can trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link or visiting a malicious page while logged
    in. The attacker can then exchange the stolen authorization code for an access
    token, effectively taking over the victim''s account with the granted scopes (create,
    update, delete).
