  description: 'The Mesmerize theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.120. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the after_setup_theme action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to clear the theme cache via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
