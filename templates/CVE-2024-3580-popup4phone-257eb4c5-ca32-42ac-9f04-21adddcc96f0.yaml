    cvss-score: 4.4
  description: 'The Popup4Phone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
