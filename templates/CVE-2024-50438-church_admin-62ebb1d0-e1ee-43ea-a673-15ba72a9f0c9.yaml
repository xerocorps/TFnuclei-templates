  description: 'The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to 5.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
