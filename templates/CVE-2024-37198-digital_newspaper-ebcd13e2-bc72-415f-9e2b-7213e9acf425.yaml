  description: 'The Digital Newspaper theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
