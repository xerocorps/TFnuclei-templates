  description: 'The Simply Schedule Appointments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including,
    1.5.7.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative level permissions
    and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
