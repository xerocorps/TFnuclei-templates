    \ Box, Social Links, Co-Authors, Guest Authors, Post Rating System, and Custom\
    \ User Registration Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based\
    \ SQL Injection via the linked_user_id parameter in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 3.8.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of\
    \ sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append\
    \ additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract\
    \ sensitive information from the database.\n"
