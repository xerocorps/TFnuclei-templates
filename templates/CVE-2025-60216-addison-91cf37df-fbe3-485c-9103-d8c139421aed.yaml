  description: 'The Addison theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in versions up to 1.4.8 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
    is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
    delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
