  description: The Lean WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due to inclusion of a
    vulnerable version of the wp-dependency-installer library. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
