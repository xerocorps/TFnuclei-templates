  description: 'The Audio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.6.1 due to inclusion of a vulnerable
    version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
