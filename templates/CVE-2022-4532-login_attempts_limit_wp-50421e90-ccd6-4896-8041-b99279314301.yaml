  description: 'The LOGIN AND REGISTRATION ATTEMPTS LIMIT plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This
    is due to insufficient restrictions on where the IP Address information is being
    retrieved for request logging and login restrictions. Attackers can supply the
    X-Forwarded-For header with with a different IP Address that will be logged and
    can be used to bypass settings that may have blocked out an IP address from logging
    in.
