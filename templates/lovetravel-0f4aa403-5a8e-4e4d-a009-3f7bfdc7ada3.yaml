  description: 'The Love Travel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting and Cross-Frame Scripting via the ''nd_travel_archive_form_keyword''
    and ''nd_travel_typology_slug'' parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0
    - 1.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
