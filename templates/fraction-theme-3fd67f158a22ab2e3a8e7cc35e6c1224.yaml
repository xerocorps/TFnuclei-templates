  description: The Faction theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
    in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to a missing capabilities
    check on the ot_save_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update arbitrary site options that can allow them to escalate their
    privileges to that of an administrator which can lead to a full site takeover.
