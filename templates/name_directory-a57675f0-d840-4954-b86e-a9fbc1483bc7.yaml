  description: 'The Name Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    settings update due to insufficient permissions checking on the name_directory_options()
    function in versions up to, and including, 1.25.4. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to perform.
    a variety of actions such as importing, editing, and managing directories that
    can also be used to inject malicious JavaScript into web pages.
