  description: 'The Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.2.4. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''ec_admin_ajax_save_design_settings''
    AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary
    design settings on the vulnerable service via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
