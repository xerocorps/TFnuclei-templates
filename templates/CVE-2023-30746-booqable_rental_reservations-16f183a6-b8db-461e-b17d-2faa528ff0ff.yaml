  description: 'The Booqable Rental Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''booqable_company_name'' value in versions up to,
    and including, 2.4.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
