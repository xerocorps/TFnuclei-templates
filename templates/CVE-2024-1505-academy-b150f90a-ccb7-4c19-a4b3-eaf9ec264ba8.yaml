  description: "The Academy LMS \u2013 eLearning and online course solution for WordPress\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.9.19. This is due to plugin allowing arbitrary user meta\
    \ updates through the saved_user_info() function. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with minimal permissions such as students, to elevate their user\
    \ role to that of an administrator.\n"
