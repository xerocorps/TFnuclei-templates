  description: "The Hide My WP Ghost \u2013 Security & Firewall plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the URL in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.3.01 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an administrative\
    \ user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
