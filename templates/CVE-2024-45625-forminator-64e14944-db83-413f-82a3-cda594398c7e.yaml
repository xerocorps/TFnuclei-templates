    \ Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.34.0 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\

    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
