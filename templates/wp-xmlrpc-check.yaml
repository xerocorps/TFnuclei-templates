  description: "XML-RPC predates WordPress, it has been present in the b2 blogging\
    \ software, which was then forked to create WordPress back in 2003. \nXML-RPC\
    \ was developed to enable communication between WordPress and other systems by\
    \ standardizing those communications, using HTTP as the transport mechanism and\
    \ XML as the datagram and encoding functionality.\nThis functionality is still\
    \ included with WordPress dispite the fact that XML-RPC is largely outdated. The\
    \ xmlrpc.php file is typically stored in the root directory of the site. \n"
