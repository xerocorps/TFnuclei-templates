  description: PrismaWEB is susceptible to credential disclosure. The vulnerability
    exists due to the disclosure of hard-coded credentials allowing an attacker to
    effectively bypass authentication of PrismaWEB with administrator privileges.
    The credentials can be disclosed by simply navigating to the login_par.js JavaScript
    page that holds the username and password for the management interface that are
    being used via the Login() function in /scripts/functions_cookie.js script.
  impact: 'An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially
    compromise user accounts and sensitive data.
