  description: 'The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, but not including, 4.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into pages via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
