  description: "The SiteGround Optimizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization\
    \ bypass leading to Remote Code Execution and Local File Inclusion in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.0.12 due to incorrect use of an access control attribute\
    \ on the switch_php function called via the /switch-php REST API route. This allows\
    \ attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the\
    \ execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
