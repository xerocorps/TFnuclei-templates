  description: 'The Pubnews theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary
    plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the pubnews_importer_plugin_action_for_notice()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary
    plugins that can be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities.
