  description: "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a form\
    \ field in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site\
    \ installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
