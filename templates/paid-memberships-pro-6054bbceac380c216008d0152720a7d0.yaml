  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an
    open redirect vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due
    to missing redirect location verification on the pmpro_redirect_to_logged_in()
    function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to redirect traffic
    to a different website, where they could potentially perform other attacks; such
    as phishing.
