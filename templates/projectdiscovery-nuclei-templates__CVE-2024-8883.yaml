  description: 'A misconfiguration flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue can allow
    an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL if a ''Valid Redirect URI''
    is set to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1, enabling sensitive information
    such as authorization codes to be exposed to the attacker, potentially leading
    to session hijacking.

    '
  impact: 'Attackers can redirect users to malicious URLs and capture sensitive information
    such as authorization codes and session tokens, potentially leading to session
    hijacking and account compromise.
