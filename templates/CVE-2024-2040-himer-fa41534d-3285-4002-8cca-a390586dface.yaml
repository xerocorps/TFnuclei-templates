  description: 'The Himer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the wpqa_join_group AJAX action. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to join private groups via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
