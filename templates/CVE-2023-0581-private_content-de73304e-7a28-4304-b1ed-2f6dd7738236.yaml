  description: 'The PrivateContent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to protection
    mechanism bypass due to the use of client side validation in versions up to, and
    including, 8.4.3. This is due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist
    via client-side scripts rather than server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to bypass any login restrictions  that may prevent a brute force attack.
