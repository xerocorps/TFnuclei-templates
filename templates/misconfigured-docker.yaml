  description: A Docker container misconfiguration was discovered. The Docker daemon
    can listen for Docker Engine API requests via three different types of Socket
    - unix, tcp, and fd. With tcp enabled, the default setup provides un-encrypted
    and un-authenticated direct access to the Docker daemon. It is conventional to
    use port 2375 for un-encrypted, and port 2376 for encrypted communication with
    the daemon.
