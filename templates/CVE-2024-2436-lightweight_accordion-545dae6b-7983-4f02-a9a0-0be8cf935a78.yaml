  description: 'The Lightweight Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and
    including, 1.5.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
    user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
    contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
