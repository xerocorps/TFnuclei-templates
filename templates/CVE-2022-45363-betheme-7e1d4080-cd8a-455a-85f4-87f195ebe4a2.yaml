  classification:

    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 6.4
  description: 'The Betheme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
    that leads to stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 26.6.2.
    This is due to a missing capability check on the mfnvb_init_vb() function that
    initializes the visual editor for the plugin and discloses the plugin''s page
    builder nonces and functionality to an attacker. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attacks with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to trigger the Betheme
    page editor for any post or page and view the information along with make any
    changes to the post/page accessed through the editor. This CVE is specific to
    being able to inject malicious JavaScript into the pages and posts that can be
    edited by the plugin as a result of the initial missing authorization vulnerability.
    This is an extension of CVE-2022-45356.
