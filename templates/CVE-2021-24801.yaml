  description: The WP Survey Plus WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have any authorisation
    and CSRF checks in place in its AJAX actions, allowing any user to call them and
    add/edit/delete Surveys. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitization in the Surveys'
    Title, this could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues.
