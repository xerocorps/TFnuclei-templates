  description: 'The Users Ultra Membership, Users Community and Member Profiles With
    PayPal Integration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 1.3.58 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied
    $id parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database.
