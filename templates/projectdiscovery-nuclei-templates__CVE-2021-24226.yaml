  description: WordPress AccessAlly plugin before 3.5.7 allows sensitive information
    leakage because the file \"resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php\" (which
    is responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode) dumps serialize($_SERVER),
    which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing
    pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, and no login or administrator
    role is required.
  impact: 'An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive
    information.
