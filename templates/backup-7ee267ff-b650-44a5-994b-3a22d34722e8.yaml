  description: "The WordPress Backup and Migrate Plugin \u2013 Backup Guard plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type\
    \ validation in the backup_guard_get_import_backup() function in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected\
    \ sites server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
