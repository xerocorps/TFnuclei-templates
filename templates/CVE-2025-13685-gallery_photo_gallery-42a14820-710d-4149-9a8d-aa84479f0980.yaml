  description: 'The Photo Gallery by Ays plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to missing
    nonce verification on the bulk action functionality in the ''process_bulk_action()''
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk
    operations (delete, publish, or unpublish galleries) via a forged request granted
    they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
    a link.
