  description: The Make A Statement theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload-handler.php' file
    in all known versions. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
