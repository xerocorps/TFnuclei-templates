  description: 'The WP HTML Author Bio WordPress plugin through 1.2.0 does not sanitise
    the HTML allowed in the Bio of users, allowing them to use malicious JavaScript
    code, which will be executed when anyone visit a post in the frontend made by
    such user. As a result, user with a role as low as author could perform Cross-Site
    Scripting attacks against users, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation
    when an admin view the related post/s.
