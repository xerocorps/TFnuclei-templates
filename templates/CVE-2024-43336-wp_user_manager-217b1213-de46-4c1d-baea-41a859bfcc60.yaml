  description: 'The WP User Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.10. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the fix_data_installation() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to fix data installation via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
