  description: 'The Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields
    and Redirection) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
    due to insufficient file path validation in the ''delete-file'' field in all versions
    up to, and including, 3.2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete arbitrary files on the server, when an administrator deletes the submission,
    which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted
    (such as wp-config.php).
