  description: 'The Back Link Tracker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL used in a query granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link. Due to their inability to obtain a query response, the exploitation opportunities
    are limited.
