  classification:

    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This is due to improper configurations
    in the ''jobsearch_xing_response_data_callback'', ''set_access_tokes'', and ''google_callback''
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the
    first connected Xing user, or any connected Xing user if the Xing id is known.
    It is also possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected
    Google user if the user has logged in, without subsequently logging out, in thirty
    days. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.4.
