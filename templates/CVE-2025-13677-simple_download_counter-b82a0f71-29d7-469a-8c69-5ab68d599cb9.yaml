  description: 'The Simple Download Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This is due to insufficient
    path validation in the `simple_download_counter_parse_path()` function. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above,
    to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which may contain sensitive
    information such as database credentials (wp-config.php) or system files. Please
    note that the vendor opted to continue to allow remote file downloads from arbitrary
    locations on the server, however, has disabled this functionality on multi-sites
    and provided a warning to site owners in the readme.txt when they install the
    plugin. While not an optimal patch, we have considered this sufficient and recommend
    users proceed to use the plugin with caution.
