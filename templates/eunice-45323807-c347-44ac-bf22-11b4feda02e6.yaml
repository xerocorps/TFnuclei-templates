  description: 'The Eunice theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via an unspecified parameter in all known versions due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
