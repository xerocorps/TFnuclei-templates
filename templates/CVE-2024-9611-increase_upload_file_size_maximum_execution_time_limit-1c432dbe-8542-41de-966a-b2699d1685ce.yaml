  description: 'The Increase upload file size & Maximum Execution Time limit plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of
    add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and
    including, 2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
