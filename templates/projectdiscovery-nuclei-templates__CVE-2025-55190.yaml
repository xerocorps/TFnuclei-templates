  description: 'Argo CD API tokens with project-level permissions are able to retrieve
    sensitive repository credentials

    (usernames, passwords) through the project details API endpoint, even when the
    token only has standard

    application management permissions and no explicit access to secrets. This vulnerability
    affects versions

    v2.2.0-rc1 and later, including 2.13.0 through 2.13.8, 2.14.0 through 2.14.15,
    3.0.0 through 3.0.12,

    and 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.1. Any token with project get permissions is vulnerable,
    including global permissions.

    Note: This template requires valid ArgoCD credentials (username/password) to test
    the vulnerability.

    '
  impact: 'Authenticated attackers with project-level API tokens can retrieve sensitive
    repository credentials including usernames and passwords without requiring explicit
    secret access permissions.
