  description: 'The Doccure Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''doccure_temp_upload_to_media''

    unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
