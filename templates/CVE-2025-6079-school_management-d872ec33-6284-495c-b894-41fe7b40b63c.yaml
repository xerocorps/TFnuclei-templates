  description: 'The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    homework.php file in all versions up to, and including, 93.2.0. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with Student-level access and above, to
    upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code
    execution possible. CVE-2025-31100 is potentially a duplicate of this.
