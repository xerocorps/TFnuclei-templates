  description: 'The TheGem theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the thegem_get_logo_url() function in all
    versions up to, and including, 5.10.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
