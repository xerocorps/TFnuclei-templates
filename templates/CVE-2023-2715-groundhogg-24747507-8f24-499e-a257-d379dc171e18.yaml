  description: 'The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ''submit_ticket''
    function in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers to create a support ticket that sends the website''s data
    to the plugin developer, and it is also possible to create an admin access with
    an auto login link that is also sent to the plugin developer with the ticket.
    It only works if the plugin is activated with a valid license.
