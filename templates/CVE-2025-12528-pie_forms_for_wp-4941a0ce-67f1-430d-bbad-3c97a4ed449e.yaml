  description: 'The Pie Forms for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.6 via the format_classic function.
    This is due to insufficient file type validation where the validate_classic method
    validates file extensions and sets error messages but does not prevent the file
    upload process from continuing. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to upload files with dangerous extensions such as PHP, which makes remote code
    execution possible. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs
    to guess the directory in which the file is placed (which is a somewhat predictable
    hash). In addition to that, the file name is generated using a secure hash method,
    limiting the exploitability of this vulnerability.
