  description: "The The Ultimate Video Player For WordPress \u2013 by Presto Player\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's\
    \ settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to missing authorization\
    \ on a REST API endpoint and  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\
    \ on the settinfs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
