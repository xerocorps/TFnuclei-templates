  description: 'The ARforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read
    in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on
    the server, which can expose DB credentials when the wp-config.php file is read.
