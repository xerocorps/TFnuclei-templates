  description: "The Frontend File Manager & Sharing \u2013 User Private Files plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type\
    \ validation in the upload_doc_callback function in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber level\
    \ permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server\
    \ which may make remote code execution possible under certain conditions. The\
    \ plugin adds a Rewrite Rule to the site's .htaccess file in order to ensure that\
    \ direct file access is not possible. However, deactivation of the plugin or resetting\
    \ of the .htaccess file would lead to potential for Remote Code Execution. Servers\
    \ other than Apache may ignore .htaccess files and be vulnerable to RCE.\n"
