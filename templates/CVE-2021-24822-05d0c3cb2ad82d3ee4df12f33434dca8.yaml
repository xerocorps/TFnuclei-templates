  description: 'The Stylish Cost Calculator WordPress plugin before 7.0.4 does not
    have any authorisation and CSRF checks on some of its AJAX actions (available
    to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber
    to call them, and perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in
    admin, as well as frontend users due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping
    in some parameters
