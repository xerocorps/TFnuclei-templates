  description: WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code
    by leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which
    is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This
    is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment
    function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally
    available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology
    is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase
    the attacker's privileges.
