  description: 'The Meetup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly
    verifying a user''s identity prior to authenticating them via the facebook_register()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any
    user, granted they know their email address.
