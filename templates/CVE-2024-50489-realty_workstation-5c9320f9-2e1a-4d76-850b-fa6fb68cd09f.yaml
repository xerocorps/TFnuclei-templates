  description: 'The Realty Workstation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.45. This is due to the plugin
    not properly verifying a users identify prior to allowing them to access an account.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users,
    such as administrators.
