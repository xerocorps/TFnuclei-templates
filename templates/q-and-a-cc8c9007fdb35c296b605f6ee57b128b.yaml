  description: The Q and A plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.0.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on various functions/parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform SQLIs and XSSs (vulnerabilities explained in detail in reference)
    via forged requests granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
