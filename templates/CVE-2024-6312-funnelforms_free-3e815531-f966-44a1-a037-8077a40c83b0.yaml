  description: 'The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.2 via the ''af2DeleteFontFile''
    function. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path
    prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files, including the
    wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible.
