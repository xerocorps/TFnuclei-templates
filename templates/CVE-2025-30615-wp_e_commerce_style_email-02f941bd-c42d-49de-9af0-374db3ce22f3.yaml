  description: 'The WP e-Commerce Style Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
