  description: 'The Advance Seat Reservation Management for WooCommerce plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 3.1
    due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
    preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that
    can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
