  description: 'Ensure that the IAM policy associated with your Google Cloud Key Management
    Service (KMS) keys restricts anonymous and/or public access. The KMS cryptographic
    keys are controlled by Cloud IAM policies, which should not include bindings for
    "allUsers" and "allAuthenticatedUsers" to prevent public internet access.

    '
  impact: 'If a KMS key is accessible to "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers", it
    means any internet user can access this cryptographic resource, potentially leading
    to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

  remediation: 'Update the IAM policy for your KMS keys by removing any bindings that
    include "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" to restrict access to authenticated
    and authorized users only.
