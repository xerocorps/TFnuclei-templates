  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar \u2014 Simply Schedule Appointments\
    \ Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via an unknown\
    \ parameter in all versions up to 1.6.6.1 (exclusive) due to insufficient escaping\
    \ on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing\
    \ SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator\
    \ access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries\
    \ that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n"
