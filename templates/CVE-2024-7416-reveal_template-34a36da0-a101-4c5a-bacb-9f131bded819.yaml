  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-7416
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    cvss-score: 5.3
  description: 'The Reveal Template plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path
    Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.7. This is due to the plugin
    allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has display_errors on.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path
    of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information
    displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present
    for damage to an affected website.
