  description: 'The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.58. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
