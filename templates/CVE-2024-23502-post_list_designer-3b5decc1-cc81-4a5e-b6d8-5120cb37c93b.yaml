  description: "The Posts List Designer by Category \u2013 List Category Posts Or\
    \ Recent Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
