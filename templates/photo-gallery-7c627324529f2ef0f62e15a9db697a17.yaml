  description: 'The Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open
    redirect in versions up to 1.8.7. This is due to insufficient validation of the
    curr_url ($current_url) request parameter when a user accesses a link with an
    invalid share link. This would make it possible for an attacker to redirect a
    victim to a potentially malicious site, granted they could trick the victim into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link. The patches in 1.8.1, 1.8.3,
    1.8.7 are incomplete and can be bypassed.
