  description: "The \uCF54\uB4DC\uC5E0\uC0F5 \uC18C\uC15C\uD1A1 plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page.\n"
