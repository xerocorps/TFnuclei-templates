  description: "The WPBakery Visual Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 7.7 via the 'layout_name'\
    \ parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level\
    \ access and above, and with post permissions granted by an Administrator, to\
    \ include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of\
    \ any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain\
    \ sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201C\
    safe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
