  description: "The CRM WordPress Plugin \u2013 RepairBuddy plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 3.8120. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's\
    \ identity prior to updating their email through the wc_update_user_data AJAX\
    \ action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level\
    \ access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators,\
    \ and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.\n"
