  description: 'The File Uploader for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the callback
    function for the ''add-image-data'' REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and
    including, 1.0.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    arbitrary files to the Uploadcare service and subsequently download them on the
    affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
