  description: 'The Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.5.78 due to insufficient sanitization
    and escaping on SVG uploads. This makes it possible for low-level authenticated
    attackers, such as authors, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
