  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.8. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_init function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke select functions using the ''um_admin_do_action__''
    hook via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
