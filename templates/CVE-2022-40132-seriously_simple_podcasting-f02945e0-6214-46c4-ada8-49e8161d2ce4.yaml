  description: 'The Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.16.0. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_step function as well
    as other functions related to onboarding. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to invoke those functions and change plugin settings via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
