  description: 'The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
    Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.14 via the action parameter
    in one of its shortcodes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php
    files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
    can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
    execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
