  description: 'The Eyewear prescription form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to
    a missing capability check on the adminSetting() function in all versions up to,
    and including, 4.0.18. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update
    the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration
    for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
