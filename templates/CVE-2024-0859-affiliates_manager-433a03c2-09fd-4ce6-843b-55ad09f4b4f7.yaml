  description: 'The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.34. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action function in ListAffiliatesTable.php.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliates via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
