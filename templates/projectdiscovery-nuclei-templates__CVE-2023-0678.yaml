  description: 'In phpIPAM 1.5.1, an unauthenticated user could download the list
    of high-usage IP subnets that contains sensitive information such as a subnet
    description, IP ranges, and usage rates via find_full_subnets.php endpoint. The
    bug lies in the fact that find_full_subnets.php does not verify if the user is
    authorized to access the data, and if the script was started from a command line.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can access sensitive network information including
    IP subnet descriptions, ranges, and usage rates through the find_full_subnets.php
    endpoint without authorization.
