  description: 'The InPost for WooCommerce plugin and InPost PL plugin for WordPress
    are vulnerable to unauthorized access and deletion of data due to a missing capability
    check on the ''parse_request'' function in all versions up to, and including,
    1.4.0 (for InPost for WooCommerce) as well as 1.4.4 (for InPost PL). This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and delete arbitrary files on
    Windows servers. On Linux servers, only files within the WordPress install will
    be deleted, but all files can be read.
