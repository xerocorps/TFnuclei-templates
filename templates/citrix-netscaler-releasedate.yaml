  description: 'Citrix Netscaler release date was detected. Note that some installs
    will return `:00:01 GMT` of `:00:02 GMT`, which is an unreliable release date.
    In that case, read the last-modified date from the gzipped file /vpn/js/rdx/core/lang/rdx_en.json.gz,
    as per the research buy Fox-IT. If the extracted release date does not match existing
    versions or the 00:01/00:02, you have may have found a honeypot.
