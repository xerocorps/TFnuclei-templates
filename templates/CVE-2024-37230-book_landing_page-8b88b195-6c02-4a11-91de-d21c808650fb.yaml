  description: 'The Book Landing Page theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the book_landing_page_update_admin_notice() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
