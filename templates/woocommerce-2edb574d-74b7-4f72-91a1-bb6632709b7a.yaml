  description: 'The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    forgery in versions up to, and including 3.6.4, due to the CSV importer actions
    missing a nonce validation.  This makes it possible for attackers with at least
    author privileges to embed script code in a CSV, upload it to the target site,
    and then trick an administrator into uploading the CSV injected payload to a product
    description via a forged request all granted they can trick them into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
