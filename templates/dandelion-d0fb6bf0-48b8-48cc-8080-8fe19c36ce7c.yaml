  description: 'The Dendelion theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload-handler.php file in
    versions before 2.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
