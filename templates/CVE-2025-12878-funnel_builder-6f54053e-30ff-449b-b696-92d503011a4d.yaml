  description: "The FunnelKit \u2013 Funnel Builder for WooCommerce Checkout plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `wfop_phone`\
    \ shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.1.2. This is due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping on the user-supplied `default` attribute.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page.\n"
