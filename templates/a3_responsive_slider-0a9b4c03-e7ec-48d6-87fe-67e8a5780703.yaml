  description: 'The a3 Responsive Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the slider_form_action function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
