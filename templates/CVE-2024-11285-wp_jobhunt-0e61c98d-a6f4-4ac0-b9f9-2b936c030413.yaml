  description: 'The WP JobHunt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 7.1. This is due to
    the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    details like email via the account_settings_callback() function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user''s email addresses,
    including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user''s password and
    gain access to their account.
