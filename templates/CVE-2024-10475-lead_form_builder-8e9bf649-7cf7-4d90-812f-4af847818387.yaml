  description: 'The Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.7 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
