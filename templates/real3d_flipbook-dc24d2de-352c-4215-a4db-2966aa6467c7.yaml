  description: 'The Real3D Flipbook plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory
    Traversal via uploads in versions up to, and including, 2.8. This is due to missing
    path validation checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to
    upload image files into root, which could potentially lead to deletion of arbitrary
    files on the server.
