  description: 'The WP Survey Plus WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have any
    authorisation and CSRF checks in place in its AJAX actions, allowing any user
    to call them and add/edit/delete Surveys. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitization
    in the Surveys'' Title, this could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues.
