  description: 'The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including,
    6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s cookie value
    prior to logging them in through the service_finder_switch_back() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user including
    admins.
