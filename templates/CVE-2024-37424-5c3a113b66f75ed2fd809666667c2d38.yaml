  description: 'The Newspack Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the iframe_accepted_file_mimes()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
