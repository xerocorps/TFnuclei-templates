  description: "The File Manager Advanced Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode)\
    \ and 2.5.6 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium), via the 'file_manager_advanced'\
    \ shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included. Sites currently using 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode)\
    \ should be updated to 2.6.0 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium).\n"
