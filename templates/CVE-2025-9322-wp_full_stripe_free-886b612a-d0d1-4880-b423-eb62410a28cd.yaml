  description: "The Stripe Payment Forms by WP Full Pay \u2013 Accept Credit Card\
    \ Payments, Donations & Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL\
    \ Injection via the 'wpfs-form-name' parameter in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 8.3.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of\
    \ sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing\
    \ queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n"
