  description: 'The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''Display Name'' parameter in all versions up to,
    and including, 4.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability
    requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very
    limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected
    payload for execution.
