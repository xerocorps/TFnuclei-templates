  description: 'The Chained Quiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.3.2.5 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with administrator-level permissions, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only meaningfully
    impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
    disabled.
