  description: 'The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the ''ajax_import_options'' function in
    versions up to, and including, 7.11.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor permissions to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible if they are able
    to successfully exploit a race condition.
