  description: The Form Builder CP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.31 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
