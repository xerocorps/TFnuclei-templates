  description: 'The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.24.5. This is
    due to insufficient controls on the user role select field when utilizing the
    ''Role'' field in a form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to create new administrative user accounts, even when the administrative user
    role has not been provided as an option to the user, granted that unauthenticated
    users have been provided access to the form.
