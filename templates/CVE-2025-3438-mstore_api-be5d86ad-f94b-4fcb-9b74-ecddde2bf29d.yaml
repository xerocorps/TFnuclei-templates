  description: "The MStore API \u2013 Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited privilege escalation in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 4.17.4. This is due to a lack of restriction of role when\
    \ registering. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to register\
    \ with the 'wcfm_vendor' role, which is a Store Vendor role in the WCFM Marketplace\
    \ \u2013 Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability\
    \ can only be exploited if the WCFM Marketplace \u2013 Multivendor Marketplace\
    \ for WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. The vulnerability was partially\
    \ patched in version 4.17.3.\n"
