  description: "The Jetpack Scan team identified a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the patreon_save_attachment_patreon_level AJAX action of the Patreon WordPress\
    \ plugin before 1.7.2. This AJAX hook is used to update the pledge level required\
    \ by Patreon subscribers to access a given attachment. This action is accessible\
    \ for user accounts with the \u2018manage_options\u2019 privilege (i.e.., only\
    \ administrators). Unfortunately, one of the parameters used in this AJAX endpoint\
    \ is not sanitized before being printed back to the user, so the risk it represents\
    \ is the same as the previous XSS vulnerability.\n"
