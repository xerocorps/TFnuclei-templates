  description: "The ARMember \u2013 Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member\
    \ Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open\
    \ Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.30. This is due to insufficient\
    \ validation on the redirect url supplied via the redirect_to parameter. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially\
    \ malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.\n"
