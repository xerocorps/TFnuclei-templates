  description: "The Theme Test Drive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018install_theme\u2019 parameter in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 2.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
