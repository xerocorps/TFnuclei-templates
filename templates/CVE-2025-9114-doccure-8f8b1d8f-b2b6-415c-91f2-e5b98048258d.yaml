  description: 'The Doccure theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password
    Change in versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This is due to the plugin providing
    user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access
    system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change
    user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
