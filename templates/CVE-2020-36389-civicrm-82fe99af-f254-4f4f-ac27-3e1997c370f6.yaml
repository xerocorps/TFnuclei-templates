  description: 'The CiviCRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via improper CSRF checks in the CKEditor Configuration Form in versions
    up to, and including, 5.28.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
