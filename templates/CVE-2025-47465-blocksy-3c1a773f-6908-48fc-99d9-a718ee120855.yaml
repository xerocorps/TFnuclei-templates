  description: 'The Blocksy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access
    due to a missing capability check on the wp_ajax_blocksy_notice_button_click AJAX
    endpoint in versions up to, and including, 2.0.97. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to install
    plugins. This would only impact sites where administrators have been stripped
    of their capability to install and activate plugins, which might occur on multi-sites.
