  description: 'The Printful Integration for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call the unprotected function via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
