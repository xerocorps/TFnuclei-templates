  description: 'The my flatonica and my wooden under construction themes for WordPress
    are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    0.0.8 and 2.0.7 respectively due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
