  description: The White Label CMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wlcmsImport' function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
