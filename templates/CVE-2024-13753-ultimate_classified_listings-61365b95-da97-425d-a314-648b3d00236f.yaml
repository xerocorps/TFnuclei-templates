  description: 'The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_profile function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify victim''s email
    via a forged request, which might lead to account takeover, granted they can trick
    a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
