  description: 'The Creative Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to perform actions such as resetting the plugin, toggling
    contact sync and changing marketing settings, via forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
