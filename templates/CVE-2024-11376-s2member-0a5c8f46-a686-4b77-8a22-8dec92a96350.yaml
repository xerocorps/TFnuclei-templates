  description: "The s2Member \u2013 Excellent for All Kinds of Memberships, Content\
    \ Restriction Paywalls & Member Access Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate\
    \ escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 241114. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an\
    \ action such as clicking on a link.\n"
