  description: 'SSH (Secure Shell) authentication modes are methods used to verify
    the identity of users and ensure secure access to remote systems. Common SSH authentication
    modes include password-based authentication, which relies on a secret passphrase,
    and public key authentication, which uses cryptographic keys for a more secure
    and convenient login process. Additionally, multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    can be employed to enhance security by requiring users to provide multiple forms
    of authentication, such as a password and a one-time code.
