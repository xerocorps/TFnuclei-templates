  description: 'The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via settings set through a REST route in versions up to, and including,
    4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was partially
    patched in 4.1 and fully patched with sanitization in 4.2.
