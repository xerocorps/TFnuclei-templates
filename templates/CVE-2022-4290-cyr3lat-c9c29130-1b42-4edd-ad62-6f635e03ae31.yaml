  description: 'The Cyr to Lat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated
    SQL Injection via the ''ctl_sanitize_title'' function in versions up to, and including,
    3.5 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
    preparation on the existing SQL query. This potentially allows authenticated users
    with the ability to add or modify terms or tags to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database. A partial patch became available in version 3.6 and the issue
    was fully patched in version 3.7.
