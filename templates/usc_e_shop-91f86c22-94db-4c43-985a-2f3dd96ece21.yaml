  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to 2.9.5 (inclusive) via deserialization of untrusted
    input in the welcart_confirm_check_ajax function. This makes it possible for administrators
    to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a
    POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
    system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
    data, or execute code.
