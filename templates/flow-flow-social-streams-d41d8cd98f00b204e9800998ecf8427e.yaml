  description: The Flow-Flow Social Feed Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.0.71 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to
    inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.
