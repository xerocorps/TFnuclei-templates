  description: 'The Spam protection, Anti-Spam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized Arbitrary Plugin Installation due to an authorization
    bypass via reverse DNS spoofing on the checkWithoutToken function in all versions
    up to, and including, 6.43.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to achieve remote
    code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and activated.
