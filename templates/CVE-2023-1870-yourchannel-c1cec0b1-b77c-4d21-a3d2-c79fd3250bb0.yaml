  description: 'The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the saveLang function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to change the plugin''s quick language translation settings via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
