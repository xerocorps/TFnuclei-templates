  description: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users
    to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying
    the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to
    add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction
    modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction,
    however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side
