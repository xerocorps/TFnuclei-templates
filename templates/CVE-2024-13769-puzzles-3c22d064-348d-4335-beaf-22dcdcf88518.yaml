  description: 'The Puzzles | WP Magazine / Review with Store WordPress Theme + RTL
    theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to a missing
    capability check on the ''theme_options_ajax_post_action'' AJAX action in all
    versions up to, and including, 4.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugin''s settings
    and inject malicious web scripts. The developer opted to remove the software from
    the repository, so an update is not available and it is recommended to find a
    replacement software.
