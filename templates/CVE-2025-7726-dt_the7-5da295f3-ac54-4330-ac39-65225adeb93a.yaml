  description: "The The7 theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via its lightbox rendering code in all versions up to, and including, 12.6.0\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The theme\u2019\
    s JavaScript reads user-supplied 'title' and 'data-dt-img-description' attributes\
    \ directly via jQuery.attr(), concatenates them into an HTML string, and inserts\
    \ that string into the DOM using methods such as jQuery.html() without escaping\
    \ or filtering. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
