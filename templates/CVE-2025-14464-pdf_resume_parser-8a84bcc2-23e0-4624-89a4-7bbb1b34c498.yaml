  description: 'The PDF Resume Parser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive
    Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to
    the plugin registering an AJAX action handler that is accessible to unauthenticated
    users and exposes SMTP configuration data including credentials. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive SMTP credentials (username
    and password) from the WordPress configuration, which could be leveraged to compromise
    email accounts and potentially gain unauthorized access to other systems using
    the same credentials.
