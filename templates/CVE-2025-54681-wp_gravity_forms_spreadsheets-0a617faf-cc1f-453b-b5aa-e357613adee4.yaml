  description: 'The Connector for Gravity Forms and Google Sheets plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This
    is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied via a parameter.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially
    malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
