  description: 'The WP Event Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the wpea_deauthorize_user() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove a meetup connection via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
