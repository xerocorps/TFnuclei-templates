  author: Excis3
  description: A vulnerability in the Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) component of Cisco
    Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
    attacker to conduct browser-based attacks. This vulnerability is due to improper
    validation of input that is passed to the Clientless SSL VPN component. An attacker
    could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to visit a website
    that can pass malicious requests to an ASA device that has the Clientless SSL
    VPN feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct
    browser-based attacks, including cross-site scripting attacks, against the targeted
    user.
