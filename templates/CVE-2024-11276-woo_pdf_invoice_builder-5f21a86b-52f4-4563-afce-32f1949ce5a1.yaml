  description: 'The PDF Builder for WooCommerce. Create invoices,packing slips and
    more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via
    the ''page'' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.136 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
