  description: "The LuckyWP Table of Contents plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018Header Title' field in all versions\
    \ up to and including 2.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. CVE-2024-2218 appears\
    \ to be a duplicate of this issue.\n"
