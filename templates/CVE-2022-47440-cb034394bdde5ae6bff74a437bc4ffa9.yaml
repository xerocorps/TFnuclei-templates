  description: 'The My Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.10. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several of its functions including mt_reports_page and mt_import_settings.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send mass-emails to users
    and import new plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
