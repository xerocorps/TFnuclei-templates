  description: 'The Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including,
    4.5.5 via the wps_rma_fetch_order_msgs() due to missing validation on a user controlled
    key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to read other user''s order messages.
