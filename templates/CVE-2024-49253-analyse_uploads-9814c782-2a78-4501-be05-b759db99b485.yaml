  description: 'The Analyse Uploads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the jpn_time_to_die()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 0.5. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily
    lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
