  description: "The Job Manager & Career \u2013 Manage job board listings, and recruitments\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.4.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the save_plugin_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to update the plugins settings and perform deserialization that can\
    \ be leveraged for RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
