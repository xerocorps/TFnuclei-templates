  description: 'The Proof Factor &#8211; Social Proof Notifications plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    1.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
