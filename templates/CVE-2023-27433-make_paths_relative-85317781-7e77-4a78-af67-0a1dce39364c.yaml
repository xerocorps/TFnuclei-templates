  description: 'The Make Paths Relative plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the admin menu functions in ''admin/class-make-paths-relative-admin.php''.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
