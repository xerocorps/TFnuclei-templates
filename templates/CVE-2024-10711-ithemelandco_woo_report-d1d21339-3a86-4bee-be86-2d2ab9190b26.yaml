  description: 'The WooCommerce Report plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the settings update functionality. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options that can
    be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
