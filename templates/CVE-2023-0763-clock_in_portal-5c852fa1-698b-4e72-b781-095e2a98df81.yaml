  description: 'The Clock In Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the delete action in the holidays.php file. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete holidays via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
