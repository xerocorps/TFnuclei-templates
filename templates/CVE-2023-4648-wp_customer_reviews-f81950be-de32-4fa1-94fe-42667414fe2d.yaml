  description: 'The WP Customer Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 3.6.6
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
