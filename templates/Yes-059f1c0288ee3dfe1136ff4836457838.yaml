  description: WordPress Core is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery via wp-trackback.php
    in versions up to 6.0.3. This is due to the fact that the any request to wp-trackback.php
    would assume the identity of the user whose cookies are sent with the request.
    This would make it possible for an unauthenticated user to trigger a trackback
    assuming the identity of another user, granted they could trick that other user
    into performing the action. In new versions of WordPress, the identity will always
    be a non-existent user with the ID of 0, which represents an unauthenticated user.
