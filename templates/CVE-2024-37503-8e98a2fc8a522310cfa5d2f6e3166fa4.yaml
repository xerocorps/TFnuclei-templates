  description: 'The Lawyer Landing Page theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the lawyer_landing_page_update_admin_notice()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
