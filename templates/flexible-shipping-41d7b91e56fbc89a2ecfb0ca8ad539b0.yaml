  description: 'The Table Rate Shipping Method for WooCommerce by Flexible Shipping
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the
    use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in versions up to,
    and including, 4.11.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
    a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
