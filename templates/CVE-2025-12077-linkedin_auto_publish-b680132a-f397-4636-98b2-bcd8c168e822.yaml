  description: 'The WP to LinkedIn Auto Publish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via PostMessage in all versions up to, and including,
    1.9.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
