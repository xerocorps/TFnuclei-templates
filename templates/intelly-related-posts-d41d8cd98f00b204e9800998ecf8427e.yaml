  description: The Inline Related Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    administrative capabilities, to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a
    victim's browser. This only affects multi-site installations, and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
