  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability
    checks on the pmpro_courses_update_course_callback() and pmpro_courses_remove_course_callback()
    functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as
    a subscriber, to update and remove courses from the course page.
