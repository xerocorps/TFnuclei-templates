  description: 'The ERE Recently Viewed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
    Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 via deserialization
    of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code.
