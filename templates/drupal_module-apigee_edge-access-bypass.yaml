  description: The Apigee Edge module allows connecting a Drupal site to Apigee Edge
    in order to build a developer portal. It contains an Apigee Edge Teams submodule
    that provides shared app functionality by allowing developers to be organized
    into teams. The Apigee Edge Teams submodule has an information disclosure vulnerability.
    The Add team member form displays an email autocomplete field which can expose
    the email addresses of other accounts in the system.  This vulnerability is mitigated
    by the fact that to have access to the form, the site must have the Apigee Edge
    Teams submodule enabled, and the user must have a team role that has the Manage
    team members permission. (Note that team roles and permissions are not related
    to Drupal core roles and permissions).
