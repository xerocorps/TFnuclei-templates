  description: 'The WP Mail SMTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information
    exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This is due to plugin providing
    the SMTP password in the SMTP Password field when viewing the settings. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level access and
    above, to view the SMTP password for the supplied server. Although this would
    not be useful for attackers in most cases, if an administrator account becomes
    compromised this could be useful information to an attacker in a limited environment.
