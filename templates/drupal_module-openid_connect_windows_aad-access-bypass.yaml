info:
  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module enables users to authenticate through their Microsoft Azure
    AD account. The module does not sufficiently check authorization before updating
    user profile information in certain non-default configurations. This could lead
    a user being able to hijack another existing account. This vulnerability is mitigated
    by the fact that an attacker must have knowledge of user accounts that have the
    administrator role or accounts with the Set a password for local authentication
    permission. In addition the site must be configured with the Update email address
    in user profile setting turned on.
