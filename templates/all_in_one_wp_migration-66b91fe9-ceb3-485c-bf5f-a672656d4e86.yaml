  description: 'The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the import() function
    in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files.
