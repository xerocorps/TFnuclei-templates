  description: "The Awesome Support \u2013 WordPress HelpDesk & Support Plugin plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 6.1.4. This is due to insufficient controls on paths being supplied\
    \ when a user deletes an attachment from a ticket. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with ticket submitting-level access to delete arbitrary\
    \ files on the site which can be used to achieve remote code execution and take\
    \ over the site.\n"
