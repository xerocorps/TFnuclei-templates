  description: 'The Funnel Builder by FunnelKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.13.1.2 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
