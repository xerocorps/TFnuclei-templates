  description: 'The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to remote code execution in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9.1. This is due
    to insufficient extension validation on the log file that can be created via the
    plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative
    level permissions and above to set the log file extension to .php and then update
    a setting to log PHP executable code to that file which can be used to achieve
    remote code execution.
