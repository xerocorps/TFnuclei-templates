  description: 'The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.3.11 via deserialization
    of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the
    vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme
    installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
    files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
