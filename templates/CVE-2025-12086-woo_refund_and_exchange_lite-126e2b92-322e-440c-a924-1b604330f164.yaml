  description: 'The Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including,
    4.5.5 via the ''wps_rma_cancel_return_request'' AJAX endpoint due to missing validation
    on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete other users refund requests.
