  description: 'The Spam Free WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Protection
    Bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.9.3 via the sfw_comment_post_authentication()
    function due to the fact that the plugin relies on a value that can be user-supplied
    (''comment_ip'' parameter) for the IP address that is checked against the blocklist.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass comment restrictions
