  description: "The Paid Membership Subscriptions \u2013 Effortless Memberships, Recurring\
    \ Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication\
    \ Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.7. This is due to the pms_pb_payment_redirect_link\
    \ function using the user-controlled value supplied via the 'pms_payment_id' parameter\
    \ to authenticate users without any further identity validation. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid payment ID\
    \ to log in as any user who has made a purchase on the targeted site.\n"
