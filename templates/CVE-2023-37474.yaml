  description: 'Copyparty is a portable file server. Versions prior to 1.8.2 are subject
    to a path traversal vulnerability detected in the `.cpr` subfolder. The Path Traversal
    attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands
    that reside outside the web document root directory. This issue has been addressed
    in commit `043e3c7d` which has been included in release 1.8.2. Users are advised
    to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
