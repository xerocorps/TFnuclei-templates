  description: "The Memberful \u2013 Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'memberful_buy_subscription_link'\
    \ and 'memberful_podcasts_link' shortcodes in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.73.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
