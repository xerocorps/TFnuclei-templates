  description: The Trust Payments Gateway (3DS2) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on the tpgw_refund_purchase() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to refund order purchases via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
