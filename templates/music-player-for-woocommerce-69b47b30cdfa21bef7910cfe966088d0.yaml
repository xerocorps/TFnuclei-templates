  description: 'The Music Player for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting several parameters in versions up to, and including,
    1.0.172  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
