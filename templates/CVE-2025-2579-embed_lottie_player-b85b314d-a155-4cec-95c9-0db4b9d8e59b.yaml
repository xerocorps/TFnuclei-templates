  description: 'The Lottie Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.8 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the uploaded file.
