  description: The Publish to Schedule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.4.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the 'pts_options_page' function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to update and view any of the plugin options
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
