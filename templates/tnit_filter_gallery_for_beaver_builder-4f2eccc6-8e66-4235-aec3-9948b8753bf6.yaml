  description: 'The TNIT Filter Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    0.0.6. This is due to improperly implemented nonce protection in several AJAX
    Calls. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise
    restricted access to administrative actions leading to subsequent XSS attacks
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
