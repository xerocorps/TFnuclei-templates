  description: 'The Thumbnail Slider With Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via FancyBox in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
