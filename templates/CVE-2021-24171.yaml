  description: The WooCommerce Upload Files WordPress plugin before 59.4 ran a single
    sanitization pass to remove blocked extensions such as .php. It was possible to
    bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a 'blocked' extension
    within another 'blocked' extension in the 'wcuf_file_name' parameter. It was also
    possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different
    location via path traversal using the 'wcuf_current_upload_session_id' parameter.
