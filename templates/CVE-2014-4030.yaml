  description: The JW Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the player deletion functionality. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete the plugin's players via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
