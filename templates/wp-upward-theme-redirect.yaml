  description: 'WordPress Upward Themes 1.5 accepts a user-controlled input that specifies
    a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies
    phishing attacks. An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the
    web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the
    URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing
    scam and steal user credentials.
