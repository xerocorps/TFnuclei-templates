  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Currency Switcher addon before 2.11.2
    for WooCommerce if a user provides a currency that was not added by the administrator.
    In this case, even though the currency does not exist, it will be selected, but
    a price amount will fall back to the default currency. This means that if an attacker
    provides a currency that does not exist and is worth less than this default, the
    attacker can eventually purchase an item for a significantly cheaper price.
