  description: 'The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Scripting by using the ''mf'' shortcode to echo unescaped form submissions
    in versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This allows authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level permissions or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute when the victim visits a specific link. Note that getting
    the JavaScript to execute still requires user interaction as the victim must visit
    a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored in the
    site database.
