  description: 'The Theme Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation via the ~/upload.php file in
    versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
    This issue is not patched in version 1.1.3 due to the fact that the extension
    checking was only applied client-side.
