  description: "The School Management System \u2013 WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018entry_date\u2019\
    \ parameter in versions before 2.1.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and\
    \ output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a\
    \ user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
