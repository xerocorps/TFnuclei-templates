    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Essential Addons for Elementor  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation in versions up to and including 5.8.8 due to a lack of
    restrictions on who can add a registration form and a custom registration role
    to an Elementor created page. This makes it possible for attackers with access
    to the Elementor page builder to create a new registration form that defaults
    to the user role being set to administrator and subsequently register as an administrative
    user. Note that this is difficult to exploit without publishing capabilities and
    appears to be a regression, as an identical issue was patched in version 4.6.5.
