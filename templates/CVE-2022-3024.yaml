  description: The Bitcoin Satoshi Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via one of its AJAX calls in versions up to, and including,
    1.7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is also missing. Furthermore,
    this missing authorization may also lead to the modification of bonds.
