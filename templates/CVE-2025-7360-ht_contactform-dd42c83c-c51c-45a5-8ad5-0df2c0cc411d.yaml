  description: 'The HT Contact Form Widget For Elementor Page Builder & Gutenberg
    Blocks & Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file moving
    due to insufficient file path validation in the handle_files_upload() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).
