  description: 'The CM Ad Changer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Banner Title field in versions up to, and including, 1.7.7 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, granted they can trick a site''s
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
