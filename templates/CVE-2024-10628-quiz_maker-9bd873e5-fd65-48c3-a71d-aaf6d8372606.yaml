  description: "The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the \u2018id\u2019 parameter in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer),\
    \ and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient escaping on the\
    \ user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL\
    \ query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional\
    \ SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive\
    \ information from the database. NOTE: The three variations of this software (Business,\
    \ Developer, and Agency) share the same plugin slug, so you may get an alert even\
    \ if you are running the latest version of any of the pieces of software. In these\
    \ cases it is safe to dismiss the notice once you've confirmed your site is on\
    \ a patched version of the applicable software.\n"
