  description: "The FileOrganizer \u2013 Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via svg file upload\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an\
    \ injected page. For the free version, this is limited to administrators. The\
    \ pro version is also vulnerable and exploitable by administrators, but also offers\
    \ the functionality to lower level users (as low as subscribers) if enabled.\n"
