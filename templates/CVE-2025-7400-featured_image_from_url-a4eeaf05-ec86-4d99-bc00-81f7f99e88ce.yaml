  description: 'The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a post''s Featured Image custom fields in all
    versions up to, and including, 5.2.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed
    in version 5.2.2.
