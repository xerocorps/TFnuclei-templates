  description: The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.9.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the 'remove' function inside the 'class_rm_form_controller.php'
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove certain form
    metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
