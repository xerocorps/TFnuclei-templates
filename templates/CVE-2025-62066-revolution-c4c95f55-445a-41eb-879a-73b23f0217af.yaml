  description: 'The Revolution theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to 2.5.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the
    server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
    to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in
    cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and included.
