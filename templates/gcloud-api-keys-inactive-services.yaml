  description: 'Ensure that your Google Cloud projects are using the standard authentication
    flow as the preferred method for authentication, rather than relying on API keys.
    API keys are simple encrypted strings that can be used when calling certain APIs
    which don''t need to access private user data. API keys should be exclusively
    employed for active services when alternative authentication methods are not accessible,
    otherwise deleted.

    '
  impact: 'Using API keys for inactive services can expose your applications to unnecessary
    security risks. It is advisable to employ standard authentication methods and
    ensure that API keys are used judiciously and only for active services.

    '
  name: API Keys Should Only Exist for Active Services
  reference:
  - https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys
  remediation: 'Review and ensure that API keys are only configured for active services.
    Delete or disable API keys associated with inactive or unnecessary services to
    minimize security risks.
