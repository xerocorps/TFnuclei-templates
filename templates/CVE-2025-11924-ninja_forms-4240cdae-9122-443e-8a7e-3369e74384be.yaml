  description: "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 3.13.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying\
    \ that a user is authorized before the `ninja-forms-views` REST endpoints return\
    \ form metadata and submission content. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to read arbitrary form definitions and submission records via a leaked\
    \ bearer token granted they can load any page containing the Submissions Table\
    \ block. NOTE: The developer released a patch for this issue in 3.13.1, but inadvertently\
    \ introduced a REST API endpoint in which a valid bearer token could be minted\
    \ for arbitrary form IDs, making this patch ineffective.\n"
