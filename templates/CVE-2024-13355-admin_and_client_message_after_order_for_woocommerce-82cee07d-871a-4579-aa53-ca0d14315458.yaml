  description: 'The Admin and Customer Messages After Order for WooCommerce: OrderConvo
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited file uploads due to insufficient
    file type validation in the upload_file() function in all versions up to, and
    including, 13.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to upload files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible and is confirmed to make Cross-Site Scripting possible.
