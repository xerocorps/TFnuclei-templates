  description: The Easy Cookies Policy WordPress plugin through 1.6.2 is lacking any
    capability and CSRF check when saving its settings, allowing any authenticated
    users (such as subscriber) to change them. If users can't register, this can be
    done through CSRF. Furthermore, the cookie banner setting is not sanitised or
    validated before being output in all pages of the frontend and the backend settings
    one, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.
