  description: 'The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.9.1. This is due to insufficient verification
    on the user being supplied during the cart sync from mobile REST API request through
    the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as
    any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to
    the user id.
