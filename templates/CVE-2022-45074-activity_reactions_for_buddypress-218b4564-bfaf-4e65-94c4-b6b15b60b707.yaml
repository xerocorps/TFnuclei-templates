  description: 'The Activity Reactions For Buddypress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.22. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on the ai_front_smiley() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disabled and enable reactions granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
