  description: 'The ThisWay Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation via the upload_settings_image.php file in
    versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
