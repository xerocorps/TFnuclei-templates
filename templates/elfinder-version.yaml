  description: elFinder is an open-source file manager for web, written in JavaScript
    using jQuery UI. Several vulnerabilities affect elFinder 2.1.58. These vulnerabilities
    can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and commands on the server hosting
    the elFinder PHP connector, even with minimal configuration. The issues were patched
    in version 2.1.59. As a workaround, ensure the connector is not exposed without
    authentication.
