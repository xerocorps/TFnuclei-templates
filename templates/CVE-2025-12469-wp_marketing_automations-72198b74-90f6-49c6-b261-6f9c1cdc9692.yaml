  description: "The FunnelKit Automations \u2013 Email Marketing Automation and CRM\
    \ for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4.1. This is due to the plugin not\
    \ properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform administrative actions\
    \ in the `bwfan_test_email` AJAX handler. The nonce used for verification is publicly\
    \ exposed to all visitors (including unauthenticated users) via the frontend JavaScript\
    \ localization, and the `check_nonce()` function accepts low-privilege authenticated\
    \ users who possess this nonce. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to send arbitrary emails from the site\
    \ with attacker-controlled subject and body content.\n"
