  description: 'The WordPress Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter,
    LinkedIn) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
    up to, and including, 7.6.4. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user
    being supplied during a login validated through the plugin. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such
    as an administrator, if they know the email address associated with that user.
    This was partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.

    '
  impact: 'An attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially
    leading to data theft, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.
