  description: The Catch Themes Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to insufficient
    file type validation on imported files that makes it possible for high-level authenticated
    users, such as administrators, to upload arbitrary files onto a vulnerable site's
    server and gain remote code execution. This would only affect installations where
    admins have been restricted from uploading/modifying files to a site.
