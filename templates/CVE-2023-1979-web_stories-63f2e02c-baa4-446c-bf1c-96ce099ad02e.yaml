  description: 'The Web Stories for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.31.0. This is due to
    insufficient authorization checks on the duplicate functionality. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions, to duplicate
    password protected posts and view the content of those protected posts.
