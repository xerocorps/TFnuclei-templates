  description: 'The Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation one of its functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, that will execute whenever
    a user accesses a page under their control. This Cross-Site Scripting payload
    will trigger for that user only for the duration of their session.
