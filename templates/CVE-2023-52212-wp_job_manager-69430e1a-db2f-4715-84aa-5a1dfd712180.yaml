  description: 'The WP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_save() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to save settings via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
