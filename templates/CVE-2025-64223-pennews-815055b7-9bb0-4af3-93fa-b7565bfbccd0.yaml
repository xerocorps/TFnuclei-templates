  description: 'The PenNews theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to 6.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of
    any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
    sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe"
    file types can be uploaded and included.
