  description: 'The Tutor LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.2. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete course via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
