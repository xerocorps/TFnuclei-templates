  description: "The WP Job Manager \u2013 Company Profiles plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'company' parameter in\
    \ all versions up to, and including, 1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
