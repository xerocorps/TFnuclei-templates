  description: "The WP Project Manager \u2013 Task, team, and project management plugin\
    \ featuring kanban board and gantt charts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ SQL Injection via the 'project_id' parameter of the /wp-json/pm/v2/projects/2/task-lists\
    \ REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.16 due to insufficient\
    \ escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on\
    \ the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ who have been granted access to a project, to append additional SQL queries\
    \ into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information\
    \ from the database.\n"
