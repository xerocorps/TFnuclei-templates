  description: 'The Photo Gallery Slideshow & Masonry Tiled Gallery plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the search_term parameter
    in versions up to, and including, 1.0.13 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2023-41658 appears to
    be a duplicate of this issue.
