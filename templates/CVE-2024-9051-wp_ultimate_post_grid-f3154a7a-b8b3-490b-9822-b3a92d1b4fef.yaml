  description: 'The WP Ultimate Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s wpupg-grid-with-filters shortcode in all
    versions up to, and including, 3.9.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
