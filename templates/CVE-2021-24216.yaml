  description: The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation on file upload in versions up
    to, and including, 7.40. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
    administrative privileges to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
