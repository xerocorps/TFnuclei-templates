  description: 'The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.6 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
