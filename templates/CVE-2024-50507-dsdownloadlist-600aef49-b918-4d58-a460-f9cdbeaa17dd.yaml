  description: 'The DS.DownloadList plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 via deserialization of untrusted
    input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object.
    No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present
    via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow
    the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
