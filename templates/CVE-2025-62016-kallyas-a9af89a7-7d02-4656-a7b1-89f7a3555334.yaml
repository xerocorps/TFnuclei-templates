  description: 'The KALLYAS - Creative eCommerce Multi-Purpose WordPress Theme theme
    for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type
    validation in all versions up to, and including, 4.22.0. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
