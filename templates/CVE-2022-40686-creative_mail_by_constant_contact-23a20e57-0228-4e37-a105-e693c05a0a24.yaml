  description: 'The Creative Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on settings change. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to deactivate arbitrary plugins via forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
