  description: 'The Responsive Header plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via multiple plugin settings parameters in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
