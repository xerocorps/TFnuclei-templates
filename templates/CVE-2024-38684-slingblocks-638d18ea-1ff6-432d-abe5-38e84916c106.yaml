  description: "The SlingBlocks \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks by FunnelKit (Formerly WooFunnels)\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
