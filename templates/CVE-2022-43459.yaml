  description: The Forms by CaptainForm plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This is due to missing

    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke that function, via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
