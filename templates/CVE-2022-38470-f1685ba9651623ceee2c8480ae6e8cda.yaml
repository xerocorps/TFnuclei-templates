  description: 'The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin contains several AJAX
    actions that are not protected by capability or nonce checks in versions up to,
    and including, 5.3.5. This allows unauthenticated attackers to perform actions
    that should be restricted to administrators, such as exporting reviews and sending
    test emails, if they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action,
    such as clicking a link.
