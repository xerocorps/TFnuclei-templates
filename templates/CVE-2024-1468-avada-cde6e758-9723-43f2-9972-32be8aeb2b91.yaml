  description: 'The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & WooCommerce theme for
    WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation
    in the ajax_import_options() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.11.4.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible.
