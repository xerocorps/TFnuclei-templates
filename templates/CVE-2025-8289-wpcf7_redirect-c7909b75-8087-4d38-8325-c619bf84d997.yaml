  description: 'The Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4 via deserialization
    of untrusted input in the delete_associated_files function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be
    exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with
    a file upload action, and doesn''t affect sites with PHP version > 8. This vulnerability
    also requires the ''Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post'' extension
    to be installed and activated in order to be exploited. No known POP chain is
    present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact
    unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site.
    If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
    system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files,
    retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. We
    confirmed there is a usable gadget in Contact Form 7 plugin that makes arbitrary
    file deletion possible when installed with this plugin. Given Contact Form 7 is
    a requirement of this plugin, it is likely that any site with this plugin and
    the ''Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post'' extension enabled
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion.
