  description: "The Slider and Carousel slider by Depicter plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018addExtraMimeType\u2019\
    \ function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ author-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
