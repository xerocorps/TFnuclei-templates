  description: 'The WR Price List Manager For Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all

    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
