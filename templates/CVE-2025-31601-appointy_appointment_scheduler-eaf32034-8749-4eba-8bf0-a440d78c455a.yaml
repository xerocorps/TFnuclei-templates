  description: 'The WordPress Appointment Booking and Online Scheduling Plugin by
    Appointy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
    versions up to, and including, 4.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
    validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to update plugin settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
