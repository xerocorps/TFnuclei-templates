  description: 'The GOV.UK Theme (govuk_theme) is a Drupal theme for the GOV.UK Design
    System. The theme doesnt sanitize user input in certain cases, which leads to
    Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker that can create or edit
    certain entities or configuration may be able to exploit one or more Cross-Site-Scripting
    (XSS) vulnerabilities to target visitors of the site, including site admins with
    privileged access. The vulnerability is mitigated by the facts, that:  An attacker
    must have one of several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only
    assigned to either editors, site builders or administrators. For some of the vulnerabilities,
    certain contributed modules must be enabled.'
