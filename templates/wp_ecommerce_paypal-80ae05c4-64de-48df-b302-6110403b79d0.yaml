  description: 'The Easy PayPal Buy Now Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,
    1.7.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpecpp_settingsoptions
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious
    JavaScript, that will execute whenever a user accesses the /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-ecommerce-setting
    page, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
