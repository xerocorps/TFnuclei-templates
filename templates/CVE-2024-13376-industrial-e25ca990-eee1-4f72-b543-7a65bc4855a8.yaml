    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Industrial theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
    of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check
    on the _ajax_get_total_content_import_items() function in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.7.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
    site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator
    and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
    to a vulnerable site.
