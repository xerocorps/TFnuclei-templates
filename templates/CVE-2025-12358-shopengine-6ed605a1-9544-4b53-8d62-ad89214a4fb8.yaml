  description: 'The ShopEngine Elementor WooCommerce Builder Addon plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    4.8.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the "post_add_to_list" function
    as well as an incorrect permissions callback in the "Api/init" function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove products from
    a user''s wishlist via a forged request granted they can trick a site''s user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
