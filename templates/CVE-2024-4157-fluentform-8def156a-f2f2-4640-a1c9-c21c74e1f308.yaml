    cvss-score: 7.5
  description: 'The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag
    & Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.15 via deserialization of untrusted
    input in the extractDynamicValues function. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. If
    a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
    system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
    data, or execute code. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have "View
    Form" and "Manage Form" permissions, which must be explicitly set by an administrator.
    However, this requirement can be bypassed when this vulnerability is chained with
    CVE-2024-2771.
