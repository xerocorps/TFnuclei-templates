  description: "The Counter Up \u2013 Animated Number Counter & Milestone Showcase\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's\
    \ 'lgx-counter' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page.\n"
