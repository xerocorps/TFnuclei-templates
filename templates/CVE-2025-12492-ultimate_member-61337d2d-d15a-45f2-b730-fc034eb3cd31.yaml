  description: "The Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, Registration, Login, Member\
    \ Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0\
    \ via the ajax_get_members function. This is due to the use of a predictable low-entropy\
    \ token (5 hex characters derived from md5 of post ID) to identify member directories\
    \ and insufficient authorization checks on the unauthenticated AJAX endpoint.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data\
    \ including usernames, display names, user roles (including administrator accounts),\
    \ profile URLs, and user IDs by enumerating predictable directory_id values or\
    \ brute-forcing the small 16^5 token space.\n"
