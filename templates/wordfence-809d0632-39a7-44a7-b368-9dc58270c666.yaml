  description: "The Wordfence plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the \u2018adminURL\u2019 parameter in versions 6.1.1 through 6.1.6\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link.\n"
