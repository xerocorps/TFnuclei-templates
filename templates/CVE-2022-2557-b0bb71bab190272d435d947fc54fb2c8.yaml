  description: 'The Team - WordPress Team Member Showcase Plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to directory traversal via the ''resources/download.php'' file. This
    allows authenticated attackers to download a copy of any file on the server, and
    then delete the original from the server, granted the ''wp-content/plugins/tlp-team/temp''
    folder exists. This folder is not currently generated by default in the free version
    of the plugin, but in cases where it exists it is possible for an attacker to
    completely take over a site by deleting wp-config.php and reinstalling WordPress,
    while simultaneously obtaining credentials to the existing database.
