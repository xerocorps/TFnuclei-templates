  description: 'The Opal Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via checkout form fields in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
