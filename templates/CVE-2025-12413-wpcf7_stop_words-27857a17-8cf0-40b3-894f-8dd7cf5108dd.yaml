  description: 'The Social Media WPCF7 Stop Words plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the smWpCfSwOptions() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings
    and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
