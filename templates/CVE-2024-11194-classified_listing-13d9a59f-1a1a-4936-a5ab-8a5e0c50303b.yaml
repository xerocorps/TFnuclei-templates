  description: "The Classified Listing \u2013 Classified ads & Business Directory\
    \ Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data\
    \ that can lead to privilege escalation due to a misconfigured check on the 'rtcl_import_settings'\
    \ function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.15.1. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update\
    \ limited arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update\
    \ the Subscriber role with Administrator-level capabilities to gain administrative\
    \ user access to a vulnerable site. The vulnerability is limited in that the option\
    \ updated must have a value that is an array.\n"
