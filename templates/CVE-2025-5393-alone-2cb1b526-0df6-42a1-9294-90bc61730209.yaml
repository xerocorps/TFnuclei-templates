  description: "The Alone \u2013 Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme theme\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file\
    \ path validation in the alone_import_pack_restore_data() function in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 7.8.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code\
    \ execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This was partially\
    \ patched in 7.8.5 and has been fully addresses in 7.8.7.\n"
