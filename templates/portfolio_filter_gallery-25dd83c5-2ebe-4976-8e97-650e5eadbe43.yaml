  description: 'The Portfolio Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several actions found in the ~/filters.php file.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform administrative
    actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
