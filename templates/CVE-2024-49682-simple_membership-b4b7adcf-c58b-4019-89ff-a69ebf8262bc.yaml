  description: 'The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.3. This is due to insufficient validation
    on the redirect url supplied. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick
    them into performing an action.
