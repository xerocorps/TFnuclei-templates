  description: 'The WCFM Frontend Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification and access of data in versions up to, and including, 6.6.0 due to
    missing capability checks on various AJAX actions. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as subscribers, to perform
    a wide variety of actions such as modifying knowledge bases, modifying notices,
    modifying payments, managing vendors, capabilities, and so much more. There were
    hundreds of AJAX endpoints affected.
