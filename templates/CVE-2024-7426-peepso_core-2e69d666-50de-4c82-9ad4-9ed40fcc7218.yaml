  description: "The Community by PeepSo \u2013 Social Network, Membership, Registration,\
    \ User Profiles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in\
    \ all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.0. This is due to the plugin displaying\
    \ errors and allowing direct access to the sse.php file. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application,\
    \ which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful\
    \ on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an\
    \ affected website.\n"
