  description: 'The E Unlocked - Student Result plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is
    due to missing nonce validation in the ~/menu-files/settings/settings.php file.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings
    and upload arbitrary files due to missing file type validation via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
