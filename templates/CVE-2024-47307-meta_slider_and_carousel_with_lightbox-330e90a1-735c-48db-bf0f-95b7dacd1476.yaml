  description: 'The Meta slider and carousel with lightbox plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.0.1
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
