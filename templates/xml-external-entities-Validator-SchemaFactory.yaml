  description: XXE (XML External Entity) attacks in Java involve exploiting vulnerabilities
    in XML parsers to read sensitive files on the server or execute arbitrary code.
    These attacks can be mitigated by disabling external entity processing or using
    a secure XML parser such as Validator or SchemaFactory.
