  description: 'The iPaymu Payment Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Missing Authentication in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2
    via the ''check_ipaymu_response'' function. This is due to the plugin not validating
    webhook request authenticity through signature verification or origin checks.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to mark WooCommerce orders
    as paid by sending crafted POST requests to the webhook endpoint without any payment
    occurring, as well as enumerate order IDs and obtain valid order keys via GET
    requests, exposing customer order PII including names, addresses, and purchased
    products.
