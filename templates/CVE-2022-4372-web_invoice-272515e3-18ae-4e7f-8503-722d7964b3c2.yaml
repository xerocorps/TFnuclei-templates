  description: 'The Web Invoice plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 2.1.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user
    supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database. By default this applies to administrators but depending on
    the plugin configuration can also allow other authenticated users such as subscribers
    to exploit this.
