  description: 'The Resource Library for Logged In Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This
    is due to missing nonce validation on multiple administrative functions. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform various unauthorized
    actions including creating, editing, and deleting resources and categories via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
