  description: 'The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.0.8. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the function associated with the qsm_remove_file_fd_question
    AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary
    media files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
