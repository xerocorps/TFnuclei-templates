  description: 'The Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions (including omnivo_calendar_ajax_events_settings_save
    and omnivo_calendar_ajax_omnivo_calendar_delete_shortcode) in versions up to,
    and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those functions leading to setting
    changes and shortcode deletion among other issues.
