  description: 'The Classima theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-site
    Scripting in versions up to 2.1.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on the ''q'' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This also affects
    the Classified Listing plugin before 2.2.14, Classified Listing Pro plugin before
    2.0.20, Classified Listing Store & Membership plugin before 1.4.20 and Classima
    Core plugin before 1.10
