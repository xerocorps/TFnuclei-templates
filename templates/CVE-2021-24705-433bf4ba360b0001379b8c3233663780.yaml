  description: 'The NEX-Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the update_record() function, in addition to many other functions.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings
    and inject malicious JavaScripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
