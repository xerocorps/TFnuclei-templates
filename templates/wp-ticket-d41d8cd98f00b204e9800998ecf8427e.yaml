  description: The Zebra_Form library present in the WP Inimat, Ad Swapper, Drug Search,
    Teaser Maker, and Customer Service Software & Support Ticket System Plugins for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'form' and 'control'
    parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.9.8 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
