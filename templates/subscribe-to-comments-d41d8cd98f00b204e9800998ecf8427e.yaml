  description: "The Subscribe to Comments for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File\
    \ Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 via the Path to header value.\
    \ This allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges and above,\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included. This same function\
    \ can also be used to execute arbitrary PHP code."
