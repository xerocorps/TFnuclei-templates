  description: 'The Swift Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via several of the plugin''s shortcodes in all versions up to, and including,
    2.7.31 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
    attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response
    from the vendor to send over the vulnerability details.
