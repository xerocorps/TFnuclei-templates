  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-29797
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 6.4
  description: 'The Grid Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. CVE-2024-1658 is potentially
    a duplicate of this issue.
