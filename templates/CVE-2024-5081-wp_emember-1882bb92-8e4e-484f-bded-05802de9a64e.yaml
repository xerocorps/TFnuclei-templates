  description: 'The Wp EMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to 10.7.0 (exclusive). This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''eMember_settings_menu'' page. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings and inject malicious web
    scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
