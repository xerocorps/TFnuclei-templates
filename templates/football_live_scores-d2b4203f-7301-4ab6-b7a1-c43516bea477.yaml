  description: 'The Football Live Scores plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to missing capability checks on several functions such as ajax_set_lang,
    ajax_set_gmt, ajax_set_support_link, and ajax_set_support_time all called via
    AJAX hooks in versions up to, and including, 1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber level permissions and above to modify the plugin''s
    settings.
