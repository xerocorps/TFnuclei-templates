  description: 'The Admin in English with Switch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the enable_eng function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify administrator language
    settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
