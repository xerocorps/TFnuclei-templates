  description: 'The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 56.0.
    This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious code via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
