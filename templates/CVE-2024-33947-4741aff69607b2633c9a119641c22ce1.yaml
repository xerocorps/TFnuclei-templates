  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 User Registration Plugin with Custom\
    \ Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.2.0 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
