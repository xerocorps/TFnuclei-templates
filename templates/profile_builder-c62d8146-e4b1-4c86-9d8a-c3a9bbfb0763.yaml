    \ Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.1.59. This is due to a failure to restrict access on the password\
    \ reset form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset passwords\
    \ of user accounts, including administrator accounts.\n"
