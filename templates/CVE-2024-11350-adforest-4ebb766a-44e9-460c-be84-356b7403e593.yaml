  description: 'The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    password through the adforest_reset_password() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including
    administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
