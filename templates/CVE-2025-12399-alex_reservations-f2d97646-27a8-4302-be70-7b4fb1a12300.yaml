  description: 'The Alex Reservations: Smart Restaurant Booking plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in
    the /wp-json/srr/v1/app/upload/file REST endpoint in all versions up to, and including,
    2.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
    access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which
    may make remote code execution possible.
