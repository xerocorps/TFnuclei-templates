  description: 'The Dyn Business Panel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
