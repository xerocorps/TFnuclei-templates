  description: 'McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) is vulnerable to a ZipSlip vulnerability
    which allows arbitrary file upload when archives are unpacked if the names of
    the packed files are not properly sanitized. An attacker can create archives with
    files containing "../" in their names, making it possible to upload arbitrary
    files to arbitrary directories or overwrite existing ones during archive extraction.
