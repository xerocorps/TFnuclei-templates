  description: "The SiteSEO \u2013 SEO Simplified plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Improper Authorization leading to Sensitive Post Meta Disclosure in versions\
    \ up to and including 1.3.2. This is due to missing object-level authorization\
    \ checks in the resolve_variables() AJAX handler. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers with the siteseo_manage capability (e.g., Author-level users who have\
    \ been granted SiteSEO access by an administrator) to read arbitrary post metadata\
    \ from any post, page, attachment, or WooCommerce order they cannot edit, via\
    \ the custom field variable resolution feature granted they have been given access\
    \ to SiteSEO by an administrator and legacy storage is enabled. In affected WooCommerce\
    \ installations, this exposes sensitive customer billing information including\
    \ names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and payment methods.\n"
