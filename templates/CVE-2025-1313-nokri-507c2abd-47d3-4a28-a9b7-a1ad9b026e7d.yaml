  description: 'The Nokri - Job Board WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
    1.6.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user''s
    email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user''s
    password and gain access to their account.
