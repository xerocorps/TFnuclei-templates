  description: 'Amazon S3 uses this bucket key to create unique data keys for objects
    in a bucket, avoiding the need for additional KMS requests to complete encryption
    operations, and this translates to reduction of request traffic from Amazon S3
    to KMS, allowing you to access encrypted objects within your S3 buckets at a fraction
