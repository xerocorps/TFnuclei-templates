    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Make Email Customizer for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation
    due to a missing capability check on the ''save_meta'' function in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
    site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator
    and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
    to a vulnerable site.
