  description: 'The Chronoforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several functions in the plugin. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to perform a wide variety of actions such as creating
    a new form via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
