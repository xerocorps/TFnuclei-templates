  description: 'The Post Lockdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2 via the ''pl_autocomplete''
    AJAX action due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they
    should not have access to.
