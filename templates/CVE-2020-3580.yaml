id: CVE-2020-3580
info:
  author: pikpikcu
  description: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive
    Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
    could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks against a user of the web services interface of an affected device.
    The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input
    by the web services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
    these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted
    link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
    code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive,
    browser-based information. Note: These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect
    and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products section.
