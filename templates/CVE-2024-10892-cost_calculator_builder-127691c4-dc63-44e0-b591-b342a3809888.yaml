  description: 'The Cost Calculator Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.42. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_settings() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
