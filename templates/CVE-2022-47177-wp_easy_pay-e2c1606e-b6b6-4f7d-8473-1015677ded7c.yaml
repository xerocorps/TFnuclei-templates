  description: 'The WP EasyPay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0.4. This is due to missing nonce
    validation on  several of the plugin''s functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function and modify plugin settings via
    a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
