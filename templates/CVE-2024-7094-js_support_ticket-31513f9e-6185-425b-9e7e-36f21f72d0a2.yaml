  description: "The JS Help Desk \u2013 The Ultimate Help Desk & Support Plugin plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection leading to Remote Code Execution\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.6 via the 'storeTheme' function. This\
    \ is due to a lack of sanitization on user-supplied values, which replace values\
    \ in the style.php file, along with missing capability checks. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server. This issue was\
    \ partially patched in 2.8.6 when the code injection issue was resolved, and fully\
    \ patched in 2.8.7 when the missing authorization and cross-site request forgery\
    \ protection was added. CVE-2024-43274 is likely a duplicate of this issue.\n"
