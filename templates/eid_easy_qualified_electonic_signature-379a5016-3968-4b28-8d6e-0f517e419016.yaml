  description: 'Multiple plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to malicious redirection
    in various versions. This is due to the use of Polyfill.io. Polyfill.io is a JavaScript
    library used to streamline delivery of content across older browsers and was taken
    over by malicious threat actors that used the service to redirect victims to malicious
    websites. While many WordPress plugins utilize Polyfill.io, not all of them may
    have been delivering malicious content. Regardless, it is recommended to update
    to a version of the plugin where Polyfill is no longer used or manually remove
    the use of Polyfill.io from the plugin.
