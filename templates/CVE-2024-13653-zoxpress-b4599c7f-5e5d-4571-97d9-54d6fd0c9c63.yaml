    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The ZoxPress - The All-In-One WordPress News Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege
    escalation due to a missing capability check on the ''backup_options'' and ''restore_options''
    functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.0. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update
    arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default
    role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers
    to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
