  description: 'The Like DisLike Voting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via the `$_SERVER[''PHP_SELF'']` variable in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
