  description: 'The Ui Slider Filter By Price plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
