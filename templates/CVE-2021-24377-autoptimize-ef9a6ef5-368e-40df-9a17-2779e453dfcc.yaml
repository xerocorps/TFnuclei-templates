  description: 'The Autoptimize WordPress plugin before 2.7.8 attempts to remove potential
    malicious files from the extracted archive uploaded via the ''Import Settings''
    feature, however this is not sufficient to protect against RCE as a race condition
    can be achieved in between the moment the file is extracted on the disk but not
    yet removed. It is a bypass of CVE-2020-24948.
