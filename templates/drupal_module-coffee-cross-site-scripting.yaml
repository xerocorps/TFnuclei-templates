  description: The Coffee module helps you to navigate through the Drupal admin menus
    faster with a shortcut popup. The module doesnt sufficiently escape menu names
    when displaying them in the popup, thereby exposing a XSS vulnerability. This
    vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with
    the permission Administer menus and menu links.
