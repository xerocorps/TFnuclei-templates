  description: The Featured Post Creative plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery due to missing nonce verification on the wpfp_update_featured_post
    function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.2.7. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change what post is featured
    via forged request, granted the attacker can trick a site's administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
