  description: 'The Exam Matrix plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to the plugin not properly
    restricting functionality that makes it possible for unauthenticated users to
    register as a higher privileged role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to gain higher access privileges such as administrative.
