  description: 'The Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''label'' parameter in versions up to, and
    including, 3.6.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative level permissions
    and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
