  description: 'The Spam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    6.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the apbct_admin__admin_bar__prepare_counters()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to prepare counters
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
