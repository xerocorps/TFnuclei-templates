  description: 'The Mortgage Calculators WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.56 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
