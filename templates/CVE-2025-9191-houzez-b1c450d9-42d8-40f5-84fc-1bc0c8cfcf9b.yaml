  description: 'The Houzez theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.6 via deserialization of untrusted input
    in saved-search-item.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
    is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact
    unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site.
    If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
    system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files,
    retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
