  description: 'Multiple plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s bundled Magnific Popups library (version 1.1.0) in
    various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
    user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability
    was fixed in the upstream library (Magnific Popups version 1.2.0) by disabling
    the loading of HTML within certain fields by default.
