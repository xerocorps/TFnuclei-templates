  description: The WP Post Author plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation in versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to insufficient
    controls on the /set-user-data REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers to set their user role to administrator and gain complete access to
    the site. Attackers can easily obtain authenticated access using the /v1/frontend/register-user
    REST API endpoint, even when registration is disabled on the site.
