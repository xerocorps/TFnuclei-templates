  description: 'The WP Coder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation in the ~/admin/partials/tools-data-base.php file. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete code created by the plugin
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
