  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4 via deserialization of untrusted
    input from a cookie in this plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
    plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code.
