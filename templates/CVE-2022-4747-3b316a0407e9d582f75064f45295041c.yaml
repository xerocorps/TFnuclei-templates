  description: 'The Post Category Image With Grid and Slider plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcodes in versions
    up to, and including, 1.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping on user supplied attributes like ''design''. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with contributor level and above permissions to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page
