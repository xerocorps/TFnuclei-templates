  description: 'The UTM tags + Landing page + "gclid" tracking for Contact Form 7
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
    settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
