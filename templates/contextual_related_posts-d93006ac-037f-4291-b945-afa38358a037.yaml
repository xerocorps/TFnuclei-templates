  description: 'The Contextual Related Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.3. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the crp_process_settings_export()
    or crp_process_settings_import() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform administrative actions and/or obtain unauthorized information
    via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
