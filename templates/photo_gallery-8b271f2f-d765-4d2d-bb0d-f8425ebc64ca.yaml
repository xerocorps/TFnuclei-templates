  description: 'The Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including,
    1.6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if
    they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where
    unfiltered_html has been disabled.
