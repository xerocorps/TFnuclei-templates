  description: 'The Simple Post Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to subscriber+
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''spnote'' parameter saved via the save_bulkedit_note()
    function which gets called through the wp_ajax_spnote_save_bulk_edit AJAX action.
    This affects versions up to 1.7.6, and version 1.7.6 is still vulnerable to unauthorized
    post note changes by subscriber level users due to a missing capability check
    on the spnote_save_bulk_edit action.
