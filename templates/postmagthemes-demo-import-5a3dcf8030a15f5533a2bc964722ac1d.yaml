  description: The PostmagThemes Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to
    insufficient file type validation on imported files that makes it possible for
    high-level authenticated users, such as administrators, to upload arbitrary files
    onto a vulnerable site's server and gain remote code execution. This would only
    affect installations where admins have been restricted from uploading/modifying
    files to a site.
