  description: 'The AJAX Multi Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''upload.php'' file in
    versions up to, and including, 1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
