  description: "The Comments \u2013 wpDiscuz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.24. This is\
    \ due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login\
    \ token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any\
    \ existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to\
    \ the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service\
    \ returning the token.\n"
