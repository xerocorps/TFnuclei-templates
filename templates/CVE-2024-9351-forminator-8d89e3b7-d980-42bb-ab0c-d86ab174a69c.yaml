  description: "The Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form\
    \ Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in\
    \ all versions up to, and including, 1.35.1. This is due to missing or incorrect\
    \ nonce validation on the quiz 'create_module' function. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to create draft quizzes via a forged request granted\
    \ they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking\
    \ on a link.\n"
