  description: 'The WP Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated
    Post-Confirmation Booking Manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 10.10.
    This is due to the plugin not properly requiring re-verification after a booking
    has been made and a change is being attempted. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to manipulate their confirmed bookings, even after they have been approved.
