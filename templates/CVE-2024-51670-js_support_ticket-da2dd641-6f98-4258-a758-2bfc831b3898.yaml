  description: "The JS Help Desk \u2013 Best Help Desk & Support Plugin plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and\
    \ including, 2.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
