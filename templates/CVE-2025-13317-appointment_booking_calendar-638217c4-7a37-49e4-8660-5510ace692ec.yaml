  description: 'The Appointment Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.96. This is
    due to the plugin exposing an unauthenticated booking processing endpoint (cpabc_appointments_check_IPN_verification)
    that trusts attacker-supplied payment notifications without verifying their origin,
    authenticity, or requiring proper authorization checks. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily confirm bookings and insert them
    into the live calendar via the ''cpabc_ipncheck'' parameter, triggering administrative
    and customer notification emails and disrupting operations.
