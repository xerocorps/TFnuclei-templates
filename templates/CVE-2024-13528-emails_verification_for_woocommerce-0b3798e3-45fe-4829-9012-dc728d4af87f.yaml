  description: 'The Customer Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.5.
    This is due to the presence of a shortcode that will generate a confirmation link
    with a placeholder email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Contributor-level access and above, to generate a verification link for any
    unverified user and log into the account. The ''Fine tune placement'' option must
    be enabled in the plugin settings in order to exploit the vulnerability.
