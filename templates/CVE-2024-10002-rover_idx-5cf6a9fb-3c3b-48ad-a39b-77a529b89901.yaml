  description: 'The Rover IDX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.0.2905. This is due to insufficient
    validation and capability check on the ''rover_idx_refresh_social_callback'' function.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
    and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability is partially patched
    in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906.
