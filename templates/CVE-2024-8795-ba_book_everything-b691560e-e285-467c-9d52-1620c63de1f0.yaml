  description: 'The BA Book Everything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.20. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the my_account_update() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update a user''s account details
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to reset a user''s
    password and gain access to their account.
