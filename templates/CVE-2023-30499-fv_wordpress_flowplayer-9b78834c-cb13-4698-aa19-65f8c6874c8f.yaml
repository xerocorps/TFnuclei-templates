  description: "The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018id\u2019 parameter in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 7.5.32.7212 due to insufficient input sanitization and\
    \ output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a\
    \ user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
