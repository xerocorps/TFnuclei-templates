  description: 'The PostGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the ''PostGalleryUploader'' class
    functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.5. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
