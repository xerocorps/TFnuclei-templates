  description: The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.7. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the function _accua_forms_form_edit_action.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete forms created with
    this plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
