  description: "The Responsive Addons for Elementor \u2013 Free Elementor Addons Plugin\
    \ and Elementor Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.4 via several widgets. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
