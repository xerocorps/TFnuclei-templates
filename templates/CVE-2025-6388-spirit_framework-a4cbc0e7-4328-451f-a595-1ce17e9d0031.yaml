  description: 'The Spirit Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.14. This is due to the custom_actions()
    function not properly validating a user''s identity prior to authenticating them
    to the site. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as
    any user, including administrators, granted they have access to the administrator''s
    username.
