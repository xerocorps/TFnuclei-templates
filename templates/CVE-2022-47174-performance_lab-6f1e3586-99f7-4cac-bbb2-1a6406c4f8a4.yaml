  description: 'The Performance Lab plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the dismiss-wp-pointer AJAX action. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss new feature pointers via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
