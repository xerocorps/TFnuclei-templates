  description: 'The Advanced Shipment Tracking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.2. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the paginate_shipping_provider_list
    and filter_shipping_provider_list functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to filter visible shipping providers via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
