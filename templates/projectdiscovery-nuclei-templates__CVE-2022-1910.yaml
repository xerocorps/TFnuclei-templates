  description: 'WordPress Shortcodes and extra features plugin for the Phlox theme
    before 2.9.8 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not
    sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the response. An
    attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in
    the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based
    authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website, potentially
    leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.
