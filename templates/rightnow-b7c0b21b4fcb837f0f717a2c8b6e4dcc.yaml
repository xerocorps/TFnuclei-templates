  description: The Right Now theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the 'upload_settings_image.php' file. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
