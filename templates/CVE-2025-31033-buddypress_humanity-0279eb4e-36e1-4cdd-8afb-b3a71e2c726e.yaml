  description: 'The Buddypress Humanity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to elevate the privileges of an arbitrary user via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
