  description: 'The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check on the SaveCustomField
    function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.90. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to create invoice fields provided they can trick an
    admin into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
