  description: "The Timeline and History slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.3 via the 'design'\
    \ attribute of the plugin's shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary\
    \ files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included.\n"
