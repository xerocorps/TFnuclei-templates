  description: "The Floating Notification Bar, Sticky Menu on Scroll, Announcement\
    \ Banner, and Sticky Header for Any Theme \u2013 My Sticky Bar (formerly myStickymenu)\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due\
    \ to a missing capability check on the my_sticky_menu_bulks() function in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 2.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with subscruber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary form\
    \ leads. There were several additional AJAX actions in the plugin with missing\
    \ capability checks as well such as mystickymenu_admin_send_message_to_owner(),\
    \ stickymenu_widget_delete(), mystickymenu_widget_status() and more that make\
    \ is possible for authenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions.\n"
