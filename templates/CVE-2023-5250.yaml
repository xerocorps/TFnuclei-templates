  description: 'The Grid Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in versions up to, and including, 1.3.2 via a shortcode attribute. This allows
    subscriber-level, and above, attackers to include and execute arbitrary files
    on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can
    be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution
    in cases where PHP files with arbitrary content can be uploaded and included.
    This is limited to .php files.
