  description: "The Page Restriction WordPress (WP) \u2013 Protect WP Pages/Post plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 1.3.4. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access\
    \ to pages via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to view protected pages. The vendor has decided\
    \ that they will not implement REST API protection on posts and pages and the\
    \ restrictions will only apply to the front-end of the site. The vendors solution\
    \ was to add notices throughout the dashboard and recommends installing the WordPress\
    \ REST API Authentication plugin for REST API coverage.\n"
