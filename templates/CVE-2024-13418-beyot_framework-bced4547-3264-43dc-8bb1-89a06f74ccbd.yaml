  description: 'Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Uploads due to a missing capability check on the ajaxUploadFonts() function
    in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files that can make remote
    code execution possible. This issue was escalated to Envato over two months from
    the date of this disclosure and the issue, while partially patched, is still vulnerable.
