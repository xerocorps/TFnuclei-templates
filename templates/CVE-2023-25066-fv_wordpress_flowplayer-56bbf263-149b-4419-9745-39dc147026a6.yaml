  description: 'The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.5.30.7210. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_toggle() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
