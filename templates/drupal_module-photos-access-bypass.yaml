  description: This module enables you to create and manage photos and photo albums
    on your website. The module doesnt sufficiently check node access when a user
    is provided the edit any photo or delete any photo permissions. This vulnerability
    is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission
    edit any photo or delete any photo.
