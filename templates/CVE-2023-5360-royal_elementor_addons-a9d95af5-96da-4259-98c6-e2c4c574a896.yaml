  description: 'The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.78. This is
    due to insufficient file type validation in the handle_file_upload() function
    called via AJAX which allows attackers to supply a preferred filetype extension
    to the ''allowed_file_types'' parameter, with a special character, which makes
    it possible for the uploaded file to bypass their filter list. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s
    server which may make remote code execution possible.
