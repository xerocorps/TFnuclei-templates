  description: 'Ensure that your Google Cloud SQL database instances are encrypted
    with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) in order to have a fine control over your data
    encryption and decryption process. You can create and manage your own Customer-Managed
    Keys (CMKs) with Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS). Cloud KMS provides
    secure and efficient encryption key management, controlled key rotation, and revocation
    mechanisms.

    '
  impact: 'Not encrypting Google Cloud SQL database instances with Customer-Managed
    Keys (CMKs) can result in reduced security, lack of control over encryption keys,
    and potential regulatory compliance issues.
