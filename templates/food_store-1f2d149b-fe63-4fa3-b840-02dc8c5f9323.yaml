  description: 'The Food Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions before 1.3.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    make unauthorized AJAX calls to perform arbitrary actions via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
