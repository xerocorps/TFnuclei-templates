  description: 'Several MainWP extensions for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke functions normally intended for higher-privileged
    users such as administrators via forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
