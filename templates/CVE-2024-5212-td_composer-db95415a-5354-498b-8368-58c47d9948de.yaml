  description: "The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018envato_code[]\u2019 parameter in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping within the on_ajax_register_forum_user function. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link.\n"
