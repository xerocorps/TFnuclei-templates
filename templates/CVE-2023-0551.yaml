  description: The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the file_batch_delete_callback()
    function used to delete uploaded attachments in versions up to, and including,
    4.6.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions
    such as a subscriber, to delete arbitrary media files on a WordPress site.
