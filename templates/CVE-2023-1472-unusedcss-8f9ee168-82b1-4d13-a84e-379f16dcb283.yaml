  description: 'The RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.1. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions, via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. Actions include resetting the API key, accessing or deleting
    log files, and deleting cache among others.
