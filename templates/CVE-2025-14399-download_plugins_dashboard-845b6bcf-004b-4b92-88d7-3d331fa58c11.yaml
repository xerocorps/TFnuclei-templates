  description: 'The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.9.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_plugin_bulk
    and download_theme_bulk functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to archive all the sites plugins and themes and place them in the `wp-content/uploads/`
    directory via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
