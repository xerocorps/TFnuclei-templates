  description: 'The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the jobsearch_location_load_excel_file_callback()

    unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
