  description: 'The Workreap plugin for WordPress, used by the Workreap - Freelance
    Marketplace WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing
    file type validation in the ''workreap_temp_upload_to_media'' function in all
    versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on
    the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
