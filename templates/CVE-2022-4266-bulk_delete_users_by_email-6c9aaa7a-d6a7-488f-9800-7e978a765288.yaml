  description: 'The Bulk Delete Users by Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the baw_settings_page function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete users, via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
