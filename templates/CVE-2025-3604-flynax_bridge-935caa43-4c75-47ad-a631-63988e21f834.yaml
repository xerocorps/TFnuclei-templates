  description: 'The Flynax Bridge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This
    is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating
    their details like email. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change arbitrary user''s email addresses, including administrators, and leverage
    that to reset the user''s password and gain access to their account.
