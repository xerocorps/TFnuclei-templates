  description: 'The WP Cleanup and Basic Functions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and
    including, 2.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    the SVG file.
