  description: 'Ensure there is a custom IAM role assigned to manage resource locking
    within each Microsoft Azure subscription. Azure resource locking is a powerful
    protection mechanism that can prevent inadvertent modification or deletion of
    resources. This role should have specific permissions to read, write, and delete
    resource locks.

    '
  impact: 'Failure to assign a custom IAM role for resource locking can lead to unauthorized
    changes or deletions of Azure resources, increasing the risk of service disruption
    and non-compliance with security best practices.

    '
  name: Azure IAM Role for Resource Locking Not Assigned
  reference:
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles
  remediation: 'Create a custom IAM role with permissions for Microsoft.Authorization/locks/read,
    Microsoft.Authorization/locks/write, and Microsoft.Authorization/locks/delete
    and ensure it is assigned to an identity.
