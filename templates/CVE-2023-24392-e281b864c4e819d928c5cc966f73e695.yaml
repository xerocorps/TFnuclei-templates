  description: 'The Full Width Banner Slider Wp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the search_term parameter in versions up
    to, and including, 1.1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
