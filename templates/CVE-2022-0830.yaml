  description: The FormBuilder WordPress plugin through 1.08 does not have CSRF checks
    in place when creating/updating and deleting forms, and does not sanitise as well
    as escape its form field values. As a result, attackers could make logged in admin
    update and delete arbitrary forms via a CSRF attack, and put Cross-Site Scripting
    payloads in them.
