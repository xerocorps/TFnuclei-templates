  description: 'The Gravity Forms CSS Themes with Fontawesome and Placeholders plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to,
    and including, 8.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
