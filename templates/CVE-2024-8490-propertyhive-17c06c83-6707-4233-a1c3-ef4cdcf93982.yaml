  description: 'The PropertyHive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.19. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''save_account_details'' function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit the name, email address, and
    password of an administrator account via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
