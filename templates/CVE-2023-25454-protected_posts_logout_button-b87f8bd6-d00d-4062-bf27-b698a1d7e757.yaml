  description: 'The Protected Posts Logout Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the pplb_options_save
    function in versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update the plugin''s settings. A nonce check was added in version
    1.4.5, which does not address this issue properly. 1.4.6 adds a capability check.
