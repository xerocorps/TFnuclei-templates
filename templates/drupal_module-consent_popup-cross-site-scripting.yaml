  author: Bishopfox
  description: The Consent Popup provides a configurable popup that requires acceptance
    of a question before the visitor can continue, typically used for age consent.
    The module doesnt sufficiently sanitizes the text on the block leading to a cross
    site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact
    that an attacker must have a role with the permission to create blocks.
