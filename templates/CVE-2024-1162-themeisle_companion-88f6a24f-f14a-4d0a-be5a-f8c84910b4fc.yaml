  description: 'The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.29. This is due to
    missing or incorrect nonce validation on the register_reference() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers  to update the connected API keys
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
