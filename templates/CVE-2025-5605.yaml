id: CVE-2025-5605
info:
  author: DhiyaneshDK
  description: 'An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Management Console
    of multiple WSO2 products. A malicious actor with access to the console can manipulate
    the request URI to bypass authentication and access certain restricted resources,
    resulting in partial information disclosure. The known exposure from this issue
    is limited to memory statistics. While the vulnerability does not allow full account
    compromise, it still enables unauthorized access to internal system details.

    '
  impact: 'Attackers can bypass authentication to access internal memory statistics,
