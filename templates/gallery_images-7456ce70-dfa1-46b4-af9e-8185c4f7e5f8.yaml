  description: 'The Image Gallery - Responsive Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    1.9.57. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the editgallery()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify image
    galleries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
