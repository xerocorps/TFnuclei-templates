  description: "The Popup Anything \u2013 A Marketing Popup and Lead Generation Conversions\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via a custom\
    \ key parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
