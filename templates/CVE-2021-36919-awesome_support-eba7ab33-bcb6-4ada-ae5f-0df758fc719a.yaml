  description: "The \"Awesome Support \u2013 WordPress HelpDesk & Support Plugin\"\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via several\
    \ parameters in versions up to, and including, 6.0.6 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
