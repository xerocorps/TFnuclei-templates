  description: 'The Community Lite Video Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into
    the database granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
