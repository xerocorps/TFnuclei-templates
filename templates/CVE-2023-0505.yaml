  description: The Ever Compare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on functions such as 'plugin_activation'. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed
    (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
