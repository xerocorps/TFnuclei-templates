  description: 'The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online
    Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized booking in
    all versions up to, and including, 1.0.23. This is due to the plugin not properly
    validating if a user is authorized to make a booking. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to book things they shouldn''t be able to.
