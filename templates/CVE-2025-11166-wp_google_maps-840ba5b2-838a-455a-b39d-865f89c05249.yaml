  description: 'The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.46.
    This is due to the plugin exposing state-changing REST actions through an AJAX
    bridge without proper CSRF token validation, and having destructive logic reachable
    via GET requests with no permission_callback. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to force logged-in administrators to create, update, or delete markers
    and geometry features via CSRF attacks, and allows anonymous users to trigger
    mass deletion of markers via unsafe GET requests.
