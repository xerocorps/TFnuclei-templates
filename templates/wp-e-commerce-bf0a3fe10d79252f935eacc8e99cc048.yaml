  description: The WP eCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to missing capability checks on various functions called via AJAX actions
    and admin_init hooks in versions up to, and including, 3.8.14.3. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a plethora of actions like exporting
    sensitive user information, modifying the plugin's settings, and more.
