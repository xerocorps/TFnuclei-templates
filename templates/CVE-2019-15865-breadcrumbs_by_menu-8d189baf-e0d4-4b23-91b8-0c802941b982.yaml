  description: 'The Breadcrumbs by menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
