  description: 'The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.0.7. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the qsm_update_text_message function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function leading to quiz
    modifications, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
