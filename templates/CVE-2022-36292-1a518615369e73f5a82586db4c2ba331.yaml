  description: 'The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the init() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete or copy photo galleries via forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
