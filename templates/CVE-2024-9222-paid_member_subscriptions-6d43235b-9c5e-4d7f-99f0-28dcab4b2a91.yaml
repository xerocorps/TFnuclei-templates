  description: "The Paid Membership Subscriptions \u2013 Effortless Memberships, Recurring\
    \ Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping\
    \ on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.8. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link.\n"
