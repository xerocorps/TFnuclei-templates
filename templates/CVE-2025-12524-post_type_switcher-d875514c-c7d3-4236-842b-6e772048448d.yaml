  description: 'The Post Type Switcher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure
    Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 4.0.0 due to missing
    validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Author-level access and above, to modify the post type of arbitrary
    posts and pages they do not own, including those created by administrators, which
    can lead to site disruption, broken navigation, and SEO impact.
