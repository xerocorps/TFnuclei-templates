  description: "The Team Builder For WPBakery Page Builder(Formerly Visual Composer)\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.0 via the 'team-builder-vc' shortcode. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
