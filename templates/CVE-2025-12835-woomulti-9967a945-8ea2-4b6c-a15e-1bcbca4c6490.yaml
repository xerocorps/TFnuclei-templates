  description: 'The WooMulti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the DeleteFile function in
    all versions up to, and including, 1.7. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on
    the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file
    is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
