  description: 'The Hybrid Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the hc_ajax_save_option function in
    versions up to, and including, 1.4.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to fully access and modify administrative settings/actions.
