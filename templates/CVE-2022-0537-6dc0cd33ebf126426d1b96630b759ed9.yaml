  description: 'The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin before 2.73.13 allows a high
    privileged user to bypass the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MODS settings
    and upload arbitrary files to the site through the "ajax_save" function. The file
    is written relative to the current ''s stylesheet directory, and a .php file extension
    is added. No validation is performed on the content of the file, triggering an
    RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell. Further the name parameter is not
    sanitized, allowing the payload to be uploaded to any directory to which the server
    has write access.
