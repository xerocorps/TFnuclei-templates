  description: 'The Simple Payment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.4.6 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
