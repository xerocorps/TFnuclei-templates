  description: 'The The Hack Repair Guy''s Plugin Archiver plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in the prepare_items function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
    and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
