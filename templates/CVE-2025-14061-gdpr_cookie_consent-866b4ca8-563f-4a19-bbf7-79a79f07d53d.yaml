    Blocker (for GDPR, CCPA & ePrivacy) : WP Cookie Consent plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check
    on the gdpr_delete_policy_data function in all versions up to, and including,
    4.0.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to permanently delete
    arbitrary posts, pages, attachments, and other post types by ID.
