  description: "The Everest Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Quiz, Survey, Newsletter &\
    \ Payment Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP\
    \ Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1 via deserialization\
    \ of untrusted input from the 'field_value' parameter. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is\
    \ present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact\
    \ unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site.\
    \ If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the\
    \ target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary\
    \ files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
