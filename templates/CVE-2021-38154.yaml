  description: 'Certain Canon devices manufactured in 2012 through 2020 (such as imageRUNNER
    ADVANCE iR-ADV C5250), when Catwalk Server is enabled for HTTP access, allow remote
    attackers to modify an e-mail address setting, and thus cause the device to send
    sensitive information through e-mail to the attacker. For example, an incoming
    FAX may be sent through e-mail to the attacker. This occurs when a PIN is not
    required for General User Mode, as exploited in the wild in August 2021.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can modify email settings and redirect FAX and
    scan data to attacker-controlled email addresses when PIN protection is disabled,
    potentially intercepting sensitive business communications.
