  description: 'The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): Cost & Profit Calculator for WooCommerce
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ''section''
    parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.8 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
