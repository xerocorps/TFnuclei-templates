  description: 'The Knowledge Base plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin slug setting in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
