  description: 'The WooCommerce Checkout & Funnel Builder by CartFlows plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    1.5.15. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the export_json,
    import_json, and status_logs_file functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to import/export settings and trigger logs showing via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
