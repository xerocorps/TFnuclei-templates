  description: 'The Easy Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.11.7. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to call that function via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link. This is believed to be the same issue as CVE-2023-2526.
