  description: 'A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.0,
    identified as a bypass for the previously addressed CVE-2023-6909. The vulnerability
    arises from the application''s handling of artifact URLs, where a ''#'' character
    can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation.
    This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol
    scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker
    can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud
    keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem
    path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of
    the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation could be lead to disclose of sensitive information
    such as SSH Keys or Internal configurations.
