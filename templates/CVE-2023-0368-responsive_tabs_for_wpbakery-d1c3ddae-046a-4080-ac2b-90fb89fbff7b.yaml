  description: 'The Responsive Tabs For WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcode(s) in
    versions up to, and including, 1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
