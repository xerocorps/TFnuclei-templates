  description: The TP Education plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 4.4 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the user-supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
