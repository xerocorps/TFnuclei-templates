  description: 'The plugin does not have capability checks and does not sanitise or
    escape the cg-search-user-name-original parameter before using it in a SQL statement
    when exporting users from a gallery, which could allow unauthenticated to perform
    SQL injections attacks, as well as get the list of all users registered on the
    blog, including their username and email address.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can exploit SQL injection to extract database
    contents and enumerate all registered users including their email addresses, potentially
    facilitating targeted phishing attacks.
