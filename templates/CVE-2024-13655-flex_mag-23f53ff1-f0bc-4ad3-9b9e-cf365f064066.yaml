    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The Flex Mag - Responsive WordPress News Theme theme for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of
    service due to a missing capability check on the propanel_of_ajax_callback() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary option
    values on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option that would
    create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users.
