  description: 'The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag
    & Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via dropdown fields in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.19 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
