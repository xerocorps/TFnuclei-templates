  description: "The WP-Invoice \u2013 Web Invoice and Billing plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 4.3.1. This is due to missing  nonce validation on the save settings function.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's\
    \ settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they\
    \ can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on\
    \ a link.\n"
