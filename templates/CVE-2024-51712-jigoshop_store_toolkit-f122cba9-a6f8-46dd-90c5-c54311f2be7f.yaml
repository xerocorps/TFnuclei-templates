  description: "The Jigoshop \u2013 Store Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.4.0 due\
    \ to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link.\n"
