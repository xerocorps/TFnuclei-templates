  description: 'The WP Docs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.8. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the functions wpdocs_create_folder, wpdocs_update_folder,
    and wpdocs_delete_folder. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to create, rename and delete folders maintained by the plugin via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
