  description: 'The S3 Video, EasySqueezePage, External "Video for Everybody", Videopack,
    and 1player plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
    due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of VideoJS in various versions due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
