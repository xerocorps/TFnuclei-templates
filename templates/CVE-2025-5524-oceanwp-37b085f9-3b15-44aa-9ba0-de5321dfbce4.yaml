  description: 'The OceanWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Select HTML tag in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.9
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
