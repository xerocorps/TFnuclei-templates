    \ Lead Page, WordPress Landing Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local\
    \ File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.2.0. This makes it\
    \ possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to\
    \ include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of\
    \ any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain\
    \ sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201C\
    safe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
