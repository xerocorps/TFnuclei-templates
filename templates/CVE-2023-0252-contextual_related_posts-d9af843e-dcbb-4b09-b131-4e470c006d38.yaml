  description: 'The Contextual Related Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s block attributes in versions up
    to, and including, 3.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
    with contributor level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page
