  description: "The Photo Gallery by 10Web \u2013 Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.8.19 via the rename_item function. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers to rename arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to site takeovers\
    \ if the wp-config.php file of a site can be renamed. By default this can be exploited\
    \ by administrators only. In the premium version of the plugin, administrators\
    \ can give gallery management permissions to lower level users, which might make\
    \ this exploitable by users as low as contributors.\n"
