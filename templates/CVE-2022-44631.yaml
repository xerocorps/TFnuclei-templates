  description: The 1app Business Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via an unknown parameter in versions up to, and including,
    1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for author-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
