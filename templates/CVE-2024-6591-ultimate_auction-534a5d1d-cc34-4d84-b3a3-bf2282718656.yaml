  description: 'The Ultimate WordPress Auction Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized email creation and sending due to a missing capability check on
    the ''send_auction_email_callback'' and ''resend_auction_email_callback'' functions
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to craft emails that include links and send to any email address.
