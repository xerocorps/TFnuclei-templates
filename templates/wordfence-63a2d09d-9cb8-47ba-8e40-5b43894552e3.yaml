    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018wfwhois\u2019 parameter in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 3.8.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
