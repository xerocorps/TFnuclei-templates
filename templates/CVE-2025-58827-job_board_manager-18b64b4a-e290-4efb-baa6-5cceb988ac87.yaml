  description: 'The The Job Board Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.61. This is due
    to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate
    a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Job Poster-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
