  description: 'The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1.5 via several parameters due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
