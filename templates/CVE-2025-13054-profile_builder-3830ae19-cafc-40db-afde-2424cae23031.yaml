  description: "The User Profile Builder \u2013 Beautiful User Registration Forms,\
    \ User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wppb-embed shortcode in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.14.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
