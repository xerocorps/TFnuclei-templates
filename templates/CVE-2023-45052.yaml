  description: 'The WP Bing Map Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to 4.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
    validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to invoke those actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can lead to plugin
    settings updates, and execution of several map-related actions such as creation
    alteration and deletion as well as alteration of user privileges within the plugin.
