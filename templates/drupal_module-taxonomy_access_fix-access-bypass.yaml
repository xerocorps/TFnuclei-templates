  description: This module extends access handling of Drupal Cores Taxonomy module.
    The module doesnt sufficiently check,  if a given entity should be access controlled,
    defaulting to allowing access even to unpublished Taxonomy Terms. if certain administrative
    routes should be access controlled, defaulting to allowing access even to users
    without permission to access these administrative routes.  The vulnerability is
    mitigated by the facts, that   the user interface to change the status of Taxonomy
    Terms has been released in Drupal Core 8.8 and a custom or contributed module
    is required in earlier versions of Drupal Core to mark Taxonomy Terms as unpublished.
    all entity operations (except the view operation) available on affected administrative
    routes still require appropriate permissions. an attacker must have a role with
    permission to either access content or view a Taxonomy Term in a vocabulary.
