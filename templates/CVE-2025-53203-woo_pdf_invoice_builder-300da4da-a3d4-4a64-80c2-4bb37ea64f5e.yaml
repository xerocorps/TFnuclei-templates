  description: 'The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.148. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''clone'' case. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clone invoices via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
