  description: "The Responsive Owl Carousel for Elementor plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0\
    \ via the layout parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files\
    \ on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included. The inclusion is limited to PHP files.\n"
