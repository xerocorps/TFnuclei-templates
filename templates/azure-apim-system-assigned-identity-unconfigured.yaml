  description: 'Ensure that your Azure API Management service instances are using
    system-assigned managed identities in order to allow secure access to other Microsoft
    Azure protected resources such as Azure Key Vaults. Using system-assigned managed
    identities minimizes risks, simplifies management, and maintains compliance with
    evolving cloud services.

    '
  impact: 'If system-assigned managed identities are not enabled for Azure API Management
    service instances, it may lead to insecure access management and complicates credentials
    management, increasing the risk of security breaches.
