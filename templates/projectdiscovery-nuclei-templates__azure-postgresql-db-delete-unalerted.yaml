  description: "Ensure that a Microsoft Azure activity log alert is fired whenever\
    \ a \u201CDelete PostgreSQL Database\u201D event is triggered within your cloud\
    \ account. An Azure activity log alert fires each time the action event that matches\
    \ the condition specified in the alert configuration is triggered. The alert condition\
    \ that this conformity rule checks for is \"Whenever the Activity Log has an event\
    \ with Category='Administrative', Signal name='Delete PostgreSQL Database (Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/databases)'\"\
    .\n"
  impact: 'Lack of alerting for "Delete PostgreSQL Database" events can allow unauthorized
    or accidental deletions to occur without detection, posing a significant risk
    to data integrity and availability.

    '
  name: Azure PostgreSQL Database Delete Alert Not Configured
  reference:

  remediation: 'Configure alert rules to fire when events with the operation name
    "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/databases/delete" occur, ensuring these critical
    events are monitored effectively.
