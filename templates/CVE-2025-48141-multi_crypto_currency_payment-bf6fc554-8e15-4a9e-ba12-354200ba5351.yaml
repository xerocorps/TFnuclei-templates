  description: 'The Multi CryptoCurrency Payments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.0.3 due to insufficient escaping
    on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
    SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
    information from the database.
