  description: 'The WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the
    save_settings function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. Additionally,
    the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape FTP settings parameters.  This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts on the plugin settings page that will execute
    whenever an administrative user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was
    partially fixed in version 2.4.3 and fully fixed in version 2.4.4
