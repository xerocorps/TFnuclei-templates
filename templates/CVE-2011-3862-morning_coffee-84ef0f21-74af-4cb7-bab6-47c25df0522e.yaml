  description: 'The Morning Coffee theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via the PATH_INFO to index.php in versions up to 3.6 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
