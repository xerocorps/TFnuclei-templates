  description: 'The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35. This is
    due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login
    token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing
    user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have
    an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot
    authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk
    if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social
    login.
