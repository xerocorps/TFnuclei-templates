  description: The Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the ~/js/swfupload/js/upload.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
