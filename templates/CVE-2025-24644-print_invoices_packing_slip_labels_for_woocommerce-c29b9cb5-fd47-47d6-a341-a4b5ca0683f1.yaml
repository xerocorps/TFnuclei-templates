  description: 'The WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping
    Labels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all
    versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop
    Manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
