  description: 'The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.101. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the /pages/invoice_list.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete invoices
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
