  description: 'The Rich Shortcodes for Google Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the contents of a Google Review in all versions
    up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This
    vulnerability was partially patched in version 6.6.2.
