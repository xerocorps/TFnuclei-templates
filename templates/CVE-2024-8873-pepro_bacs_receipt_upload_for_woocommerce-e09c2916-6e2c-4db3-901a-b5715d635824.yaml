    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The PeproDev WooCommerce Receipt Uploader plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without
    appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.9. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2025-24574 is likely a duplicate of this
    issue.
