  description: 'The Newspack Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the remove_iframe_archive()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary
    directories on the server.
