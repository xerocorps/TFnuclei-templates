  description: 'The Slider by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via slider settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.56 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
