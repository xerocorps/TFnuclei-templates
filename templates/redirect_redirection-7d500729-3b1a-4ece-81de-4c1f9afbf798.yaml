  description: 'The Redirect Redirection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the uninstall() function called via an admin_post hook. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to uninstall the plugin via a
    forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
