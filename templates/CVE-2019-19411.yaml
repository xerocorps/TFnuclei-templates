  description: 'USG9500 with versions of V500R001C30SPC100, V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600,
    V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200 have an information leakage
    vulnerability. Due to improper processing of the initialization vector used in
    a specific encryption algorithm, an attacker who gains access to this cryptographic
    primitive may exploit this vulnerability to cause the value of the confidentiality
    associated with its use to be diminished.

    '
  impact: 'Attackers with network access can exploit the weakened encryption to potentially
    recover confidential information that was meant to be protected by the encryption
    algorithm.
