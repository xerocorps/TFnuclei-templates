  description: 'The Simple Download Monitor WordPress plugin before 3.9.5 does not
    escape the "File Thumbnail" post meta before outputting it in some pages, which
    could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting attacks. Given the that XSS is triggered even when the Download is in
    a review state, contributor could make JavaScript code execute in a context of
    a reviewer such as admin and make them create a rogue admin account, or install
    a malicious plugin
