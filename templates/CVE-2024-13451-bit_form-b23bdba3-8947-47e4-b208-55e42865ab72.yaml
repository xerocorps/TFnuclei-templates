  description: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact
    Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including,
    2.17.4 via file uploads due to insufficient directory listing prevention and lack
    of randomization of file names. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to extract sensitive data including files uploaded via a form. The vulnerability
    was partially patched in version 2.17.5.
