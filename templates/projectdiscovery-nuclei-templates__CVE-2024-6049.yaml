  description: 'The web server of Lawo AG vsm LTC Time Sync (vTimeSync) is affected
    by a "..." (triple dot) path traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted
    HTTP request, an unauthenticated remote attacker could download arbitrary files
    from the operating system. As a limitation, the exploitation is only possible
    if the requested file has some file extension, e. g. .exe or .txt.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can exploit triple dot path traversal to download
    arbitrary files from the operating system, potentially exposing configuration
    files and credentials.
