  description: 'The Media.net Ads Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation and missing capability check
    in the ''sendMail'' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.13. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above
    permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability is only exploitable if
    anyone has ever logged in through the API.
