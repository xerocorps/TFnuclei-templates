  description: 'The Campay Woocommerce Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Unauthenticated Payment Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2.
    This is due to the plugin not properly validating that a transaction has occurred
    through the payment gateway. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to bypass payments and mark orders as successfully completed resulting in a loss
    of income.
