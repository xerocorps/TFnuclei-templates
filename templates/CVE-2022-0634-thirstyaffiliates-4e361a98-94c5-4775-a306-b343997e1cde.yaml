  description: 'The ThirstyAffiliates Affiliate Link Manager WordPress plugin before
    3.10.5 lacks authorization checks in the ta_insert_external_image action, allowing
    a low-privilege user (with a role as low as Subscriber) to add an image from an
    external URL to an affiliate link. Further the plugin lacks CSRF checks, allowing
    an attacker to trick a logged in user to perform the action by crafting a special
    request.
