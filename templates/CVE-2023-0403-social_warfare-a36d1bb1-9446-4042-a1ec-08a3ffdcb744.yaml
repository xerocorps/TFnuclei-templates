  description: 'The Social Warfare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.3.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete post meta information and reset network
    access tokens, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
