  description: The DX Share Selection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.4. This is due to missing nonce
    protection on the dxss_admin_page() function found in the ~/dx-share-selection.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious
    web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site's administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
