  description: "The GamiPress \u2013 Gamification plugin to reward points, achievements,\
    \ badges & ranks in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based\
    \ SQL Injection via the \u2018orderby\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 7.3.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter\
    \ and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into\
    \ already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from\
    \ the database. NOTE: This vulnerability was previously published as being fixed\
    \ in version 7.2.2 which was incorrect. The correct fixed version is 7.3.2.\n"
