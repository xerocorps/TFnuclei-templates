  description: 'Several themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the activate_plugin() function called
    via an AJAX action in various versions of the themes. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins via a forged request,
    if they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
