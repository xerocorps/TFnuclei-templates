  description: "The Email Verification, Email OTP, Block Spam Email, Passwordless\
    \ login, Hide Login, Magic Login \u2013 User Verification plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.39. This is due to the plugin not properly validating that an OTP was generated\
    \ before comparing it to user input in the \"user_verification_form_wrap_process_otpLogin\"\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as\
    \ any user with a verified email address, such as an administrator, by submitting\
    \ an empty OTP value.\n"
