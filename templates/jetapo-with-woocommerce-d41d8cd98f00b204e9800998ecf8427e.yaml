  description: "The Jetapo | Jobboard WordPress Theme and Jetapo | Jobboard WordPress\
    \ Theme with WooCommerce for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the \u2018location\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link."
