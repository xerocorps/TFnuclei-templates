  description: "The Download, Downloads \u2013 WordPress Download plugin By Edmon\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
