  description: 'The Real Estate 7 Theme for WordPress suffers from an Open Mailer
    vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4. This is due to a lack of
    authorization in the /includes/ajax-submit-favorites.php and /includes/ajax-submit-listings.php
    files which are reachable via AJAX call but also directly via POST. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with any content to any
    recipient.
