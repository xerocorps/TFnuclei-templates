  description: "The RumbleTalk Live Group Chat \u2013 HTML5 plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'rumbletalk-admin-button'\
    \ shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.0 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it\
    \ possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page.\n"
