  description: 'The application suffers from an SQL Injection vulnerability. Input
    passed through the ''username'' POST parameter in ''index.php'' is not properly
    sanitised before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be
    exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and bypass
    the authentication mechanism.
