  description: "The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11\
    \ for WordPress registered several AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users\
    \ in the `includes` function in `redux-core/class-redux-core.php` that were unique\
    \ to a given site but deterministic and predictable given that they were based\
    \ on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value of '-redux' and an md5\
    \ hash of the previous hash with a known salt value of '-support'. These AJAX\
    \ actions could be used to retrieve a list of active plugins and their versions,\
    \ the site's PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash of site\u2019s `AUTH_KEY` concatenated\
    \ with the `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.\n"
