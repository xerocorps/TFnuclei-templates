  description: The JobCareer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
    via the 'job_title', 'specialisms', and 'location' parameters and address textfield
    in versions up to, and including, 3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
