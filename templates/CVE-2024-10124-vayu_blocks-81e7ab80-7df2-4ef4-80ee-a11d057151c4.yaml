  description: "The Vayu Blocks \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress & WooCommerce\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation\
    \ and activation due to a missing capability check on the tp_install() function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to\
    \ achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and\
    \ activated. This vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.1.1.\n"
