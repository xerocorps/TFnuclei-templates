  description: 'The WP Customer Area plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''cuar-trash'' action. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete customer files via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
