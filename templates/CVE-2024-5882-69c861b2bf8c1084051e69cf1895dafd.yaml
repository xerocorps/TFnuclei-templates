  description: "The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 via the 'ucl_page'\
    \ and 'layout' parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
