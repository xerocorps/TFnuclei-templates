  description: 'Ensure that a Microsoft Azure activity log alert is fired whenever
    a "Delete Storage Account" event is triggered within your cloud account. An Azure
    activity log alert fires each time the event that matches the condition specified
    in the alert configuration is triggered. The alert condition that this conformity
    rule checks for is "Whenever the Administrative Activity Log ''Delete Storage
    Account (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts)'' has ''any'' Event level, with ''any''
    status and event is initiated by ''any''".

    '
  impact: 'Failure to have alert rules for the deletion of storage accounts can allow
    malicious or accidental deletions to go unnoticed, potentially leading to data
    loss and security breaches.

  remediation: 'Ensure alert rules are configured to fire on "Delete Storage Account"
    events by setting the alert condition to "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete"
    and ensuring that an action group is attached to manage notifications.
