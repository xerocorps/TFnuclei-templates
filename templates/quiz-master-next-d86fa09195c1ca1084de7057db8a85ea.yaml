  description: 'The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.3.10. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to clear audit data and perform other actions, via
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
