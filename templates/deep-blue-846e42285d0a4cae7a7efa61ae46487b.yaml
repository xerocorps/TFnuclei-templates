  description: 'The Deep Blue theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload.php file in versions
    up to, and including, 1.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
