  description: The Google Maps CP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.43. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the feedback_action function called via the cp-google-maps-feedback
    action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized
    feedback form submission via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
