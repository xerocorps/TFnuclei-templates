  description: 'The Job Board by BestWebSoft plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This
    is due to the plugin storing the entire unsanitized `$_GET` superglobal array
    directly into the database via `update_user_meta()` when users save search results,
    and later outputting this data without proper escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute whenever
    a user accesses the saved search or views their profile, granted they can trick
    the user into performing the search and saving the results.
