  description: The WP Remote Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in versions up to, and including,
    1.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
