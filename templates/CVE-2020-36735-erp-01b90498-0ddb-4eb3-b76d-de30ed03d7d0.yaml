  description: 'The WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment & job listings
    | WooCommerce CRM & Accounting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_leave_calendar_filter, add_enable_disable_option_save,
    leave_policies, process_bulk_action, and process_crm_contact functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins settings via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
