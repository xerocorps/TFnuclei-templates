  author: topscoder
  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-43333
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 7.5
  description: "The Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) Pro plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.2.1.\
    \ This is due to the plugin not properly restricting user's ability to utilize\
    \ the \u201CView Admin as Role\u201D feature. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to recover access to a previous\
    \ role, such as administrator, granted they had previously held a higher role.\
    \ CVE-2025-24648 is a duplicate assignment of the same vulnerability.\n"
