  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.8.3 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
