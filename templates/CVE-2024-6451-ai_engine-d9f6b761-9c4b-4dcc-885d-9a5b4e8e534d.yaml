  description: 'The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the /wp-json/mwai/v1/settings/update
    REST API endpoint. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a log path
    file extension allowing a user to set the log extension as .php making the file
    executable. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    access and above, to execute code on the server.
