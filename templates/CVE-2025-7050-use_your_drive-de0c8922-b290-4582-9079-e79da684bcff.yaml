  description: 'The Use-your-Drive | Google Drive plugin for WordPress plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''title'' parameter
    in file metadata in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. The vulnerability can be exploited by the lowest authentication
    level permitted to upload files, including unauthenticated users, once a file
    upload shortcode is published on a publicly accessible post.
