  description: 'The FoodBakery | Delivery Restaurant Directory WordPress Theme theme
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to,
    and including, 4.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the
    foodbakery_var_backup_file_delete, foodbakery_widget_file_delete, theme_option_save,
    export_widget_settings, ajax_import_widget_data, foodbakery_var_settings_backup_generate,
    foodbakery_var_backup_file_restore, and theme_option_rest_all functions. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, update
    theme options, export widget options, import widget options, generate backups,
    restore backups, and reset theme options via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
