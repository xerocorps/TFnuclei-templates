  description: 'The Trust Payments Gateway (3DS2) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is
    due to missing nonce validation on several functions like tpgw_create_new_user()
    and tpgw_update_address_myst(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to perform several different administrative actions via forged requests granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
