  description: The Multi Step Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via several of its form fields in versions up to, and including, 1.7.7
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
