  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via redirect parameter in versions up to, and including,
    3.2.43 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
