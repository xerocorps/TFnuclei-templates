  description: The Taskbuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via SVG file upload in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web
    scripts into SVG files that are uploaded as part of the task creation process
    and that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page or access such
    an SVG file directly.
