  description: 'The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.71
    via the sp_cdm_link_save_embed AJAX action to missing validation on the ''user_id''
    user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    subscriber-level access and above, to upload files that look like they were uploaded
    by another user.
