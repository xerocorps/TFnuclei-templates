  description: 'The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the [function-name] function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to [state the impact of the vulnerability] via forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
