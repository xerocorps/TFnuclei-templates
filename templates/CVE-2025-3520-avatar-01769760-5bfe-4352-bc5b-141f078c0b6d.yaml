  description: 'The Avatar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
    due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions up to,
    and including, 0.1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which
    can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such
    as wp-config.php).
