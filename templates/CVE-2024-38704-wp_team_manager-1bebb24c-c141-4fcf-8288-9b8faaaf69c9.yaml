  description: "The Team Manager \u2013 WordPress Showcase Team Members plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.1.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing\
    \ the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
