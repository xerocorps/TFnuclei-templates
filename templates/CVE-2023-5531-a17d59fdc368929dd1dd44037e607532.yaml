  description: 'The Thumbnail Slider With Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete functionality. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete image lightboxes via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
