    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 3.12.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the maybe_opt_in() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to opt an affected site into usage statistics collection via a forged request\
    \ granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as\
    \ clicking on a link.\n"
