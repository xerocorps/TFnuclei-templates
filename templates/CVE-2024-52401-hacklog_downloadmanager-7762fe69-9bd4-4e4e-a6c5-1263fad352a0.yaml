  description: 'The Hacklog DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
