  description: 'The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized
    Account Access and Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 4.10.7
    due to improper implementation of the Apple login feature. This allows unauthenticated
    attackers to log in as any user as long as they know the user''s email address.
    We are disclosing this issue as the developer has not yet released a patch, but
    continues to release updates and we escalated this issue to the plugin''s team
    30 days ago.
