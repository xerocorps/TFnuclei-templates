  description: The Recipe Card Blocks by WPZOOM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.8.2 by not
    properly sanitizing or escaping some of the properties of the Recipe Card Block
    (such as ingredientsLayout, iconSet, steps, ingredients, recipeTitle, or settings).
    This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
