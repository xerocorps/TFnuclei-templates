  description: 'The Google Maps Anywhere plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters from the plugin''s settings in versions
    up to, and including, 1.2.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative
    level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
    installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
