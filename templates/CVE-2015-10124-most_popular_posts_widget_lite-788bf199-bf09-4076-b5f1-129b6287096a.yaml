  description: 'The Most Popular Posts Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    SQL Injection via the ''PostID'' variable in versions up to, and including, 0.8
    due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
    preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL
    queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database.
