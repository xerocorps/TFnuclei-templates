  description: The debugging endpoint /debug/pprof is exposed over the unauthenticated
    Kubelet healthz port. The go pprof endpoint is exposed over the Kubelet's healthz
    port. This debugging endpoint can potentially leak sensitive information such
    as internal Kubelet memory addresses and configuration, or for limited denial
    of service. Versions prior to 1.15.0, 1.14.4, 1.13.8, and 1.12.10 are affected.
    The issue is of medium severity, but not exposed by the default configuration.
