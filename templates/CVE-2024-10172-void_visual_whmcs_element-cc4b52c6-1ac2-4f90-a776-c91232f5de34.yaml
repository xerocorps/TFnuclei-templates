  description: 'The WPBakery Visual Composer WHMCS Elements plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s void_wbwhmcse_laouts_search
    shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
