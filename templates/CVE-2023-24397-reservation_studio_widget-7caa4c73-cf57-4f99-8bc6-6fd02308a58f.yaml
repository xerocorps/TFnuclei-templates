  description: 'The Reservation.Studio widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including,
    1.0.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled. Note: This vulnerability is partially
    patched in versions 1.0.8 and above.
