  description: 'The WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''rev_slider_vc'' shortcode in all versions
    up to, and including, 8.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable
    when RevSlider is also installed.
