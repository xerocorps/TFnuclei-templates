  description: 'An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance on the
    CG (legacy) platform. The application allowed login as the privileged internal
    SYSTEM user by manipulating the username field. The SYSTEM account does not require
    a password, enabling attackers with network access to the login page to obtain
    elevated access. Once authenticated, an attacker could achieve remote code execution
    by modifying Jython scripts within the application. This issue was resolved by
    introducing stricter validation logic to exclude internal accounts from public
    authentication workflows in version MP-4583.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication
    and gain elevated SYSTEM access, potentially leading to remote code execution.
