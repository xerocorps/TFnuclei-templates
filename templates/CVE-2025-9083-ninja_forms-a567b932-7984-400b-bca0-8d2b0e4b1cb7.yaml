  description: "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.11.0 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP\
    \ chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability\
    \ has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed\
    \ on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed\
    \ on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete\
    \ arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP\
    \ chain present.\n"
