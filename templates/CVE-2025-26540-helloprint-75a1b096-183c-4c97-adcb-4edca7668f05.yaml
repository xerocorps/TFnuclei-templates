  description: 'The Plug your WooCommerce into the largest catalog of customized print
    products from Helloprint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,
    which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted
    (such as wp-config.php).
