  description: 'The Corner Ad plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.56. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on its corner_ad_settings_page function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the deletion of ads via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
