  description: "The AdRotate Banner Manager \u2013 The only ad manager you'll need\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing\
    \ file extension sanitization in the adrotate_insert_media() function in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 5.13.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files with double\
    \ extensions on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution\
    \ possible. This is only exploitable on select instances where the configuration\
    \ will execute the first extension present.\n"
