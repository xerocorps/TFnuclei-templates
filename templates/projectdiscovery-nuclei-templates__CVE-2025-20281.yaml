  description: 'A vulnerability in a specific API of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could
    allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying
    operating system as root. The attacker does not require any valid credentials
    to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
    of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting
    a crafted API request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain
    root privileges on an affected device.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary code as root, leading
    to full system compromise.
