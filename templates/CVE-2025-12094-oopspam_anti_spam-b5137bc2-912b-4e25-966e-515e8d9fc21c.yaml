  description: 'The OOPSpam Anti-Spam: Spam Protection for WordPress Forms & Comments
    (No CAPTCHA) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Header Spoofing in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.2.53. This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled
    forwarded headers (such as CF-Connecting-IP, X-Forwarded-For, and others) without
    verifying that those headers originate from legitimate, trusted proxies. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address and
    bypass IP-based security controls, including blocked IP lists and rate limiting
    protections, by sending arbitrary HTTP headers with their requests.
