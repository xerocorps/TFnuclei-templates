  description: 'The WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to,
    and including, 5.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
