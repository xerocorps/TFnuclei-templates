  description: 'The Planning Center Online Giving plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcodes in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
