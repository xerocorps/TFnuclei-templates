  description: "The \u767E\u5EA6\u5206\u4EAB\u6309\u94AE plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This\
    \ is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious\
    \ web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
