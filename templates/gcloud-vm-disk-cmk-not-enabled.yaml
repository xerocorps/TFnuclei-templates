  description: 'Ensure that the persistent disks attached to your Google Compute Engine
    instances are encrypted with Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) in order to have a fine
    control over your sensitive data encryption and decryption process. You can create
    and manage your own Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) with Cloud Key Management Service
    (Cloud KMS). Cloud KMS provides secure and efficient encryption key management,
    controlled key rotation, and revocation mechanisms.

    '
  impact: 'Without CMK encryption, you have limited control over the encryption keys
    used to protect your VM disk data, potentially exposing sensitive information
    to unauthorized access.

    '
  name: Virtual Machine Disk Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys Not Enabled

  remediation: 'Configure your Compute Engine persistent disks to use Customer-Managed
    Keys (CMKs) for encryption by specifying a Cloud KMS key during disk creation
    or by updating existing disks.
