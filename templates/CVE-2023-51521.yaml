  description: 'The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.1.18. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to delete quiz results and perform other actions via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
