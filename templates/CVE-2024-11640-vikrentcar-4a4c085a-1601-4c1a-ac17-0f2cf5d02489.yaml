  description: 'The VikRentCar Car Rental Management System plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    1.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''save'' function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin access privileges
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers
    with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
