  description: 'The Password Policy Manager | Password Manager plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up
    to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a
    user''s identity prior to updating their details like password through the moppm_submit_new_pass()
    function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators,
    and leverage that to gain access to their account.
