  description: 'The WPGraphQL Smart Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Exposure in all versions up to 2.0.1 (exclusive) via the query endpoint due to
    insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected, private,
    or draft posts that they should not have access to.
