  description: "The Restrict User Access \u2013 Membership Plugin with Force plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up\
    \ to, and including, 2.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
