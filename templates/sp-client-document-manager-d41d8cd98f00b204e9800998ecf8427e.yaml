  description: The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.9.5. This
    is due to missing nonce validation on various functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform several actions such as modifying plugin
    settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
