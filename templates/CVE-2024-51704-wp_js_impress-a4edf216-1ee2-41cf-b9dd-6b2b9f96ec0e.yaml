  description: 'The imPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
