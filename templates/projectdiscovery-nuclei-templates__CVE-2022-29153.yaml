  description: 'HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise up to 1.9.16, 1.10.9, and 1.11
    are susceptible to server-side request forgery. When redirects are returned by
    HTTP health check endpoints, Consul follows these HTTP redirects by default. An
    attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute
    unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
    send crafted requests to internal resources, leading to unauthorized access or
    information disclosure.
