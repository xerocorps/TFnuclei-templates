  description: The VRView plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via an outdated VRView library in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3
    and 1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
