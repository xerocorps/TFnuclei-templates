  description: 'The Easy CountDowner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform unauthorized actions and inject malicious web scripts via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
