  description: "The Community by PeepSo \u2013 Social Network, Membership, Registration,\
    \ User Profiles, Premium \u2013 Mobile App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via URLs in posts, comments, and profiles when\
    \ Markdown support is enabled in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.1 due\
    \ to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an\
    \ injected page.\n"
