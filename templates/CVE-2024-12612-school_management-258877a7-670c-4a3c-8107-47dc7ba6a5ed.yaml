  description: 'The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to SQL Injection via several parameters across multiple AJAX action
    in all versions up to, and including, 93.2.0 due to insufficient escaping on the
    user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL
    query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
    information from the database.
