  description: 'The Comments Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings
    function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as
    a subscriber, to reset the plugin''s settings. NOTE: this issue is was only partially
    patched in version 1.2.0, as the nonce is still present to subscriber-level users.
