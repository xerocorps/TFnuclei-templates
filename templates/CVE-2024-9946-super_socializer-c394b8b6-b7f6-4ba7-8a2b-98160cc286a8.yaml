  description: "The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin \u2013 Super\
    \ Socializer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 7.13.68. This is due to insufficient verification\
    \ on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if\
    \ they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing\
    \ account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate\
    \ as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication\
    \ for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login. The vulnerability\
    \ was partially patched in version 7.13.68.\n"
