  description: 'The WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discount Rules plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    2.4.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to control the plugin''s settings via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
