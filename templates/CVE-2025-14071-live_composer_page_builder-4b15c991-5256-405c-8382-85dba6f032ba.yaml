  description: "The Live Composer \u2013 Free WordPress Website Builder plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the dslc_module_posts_output\
    \ shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the\
    \ vulnerable plugin, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another\
    \ plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain\
    \ is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,\
    \ it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.\n"
