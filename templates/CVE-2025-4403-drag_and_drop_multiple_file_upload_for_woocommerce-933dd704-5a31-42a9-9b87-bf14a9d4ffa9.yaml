  description: "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.1.6 due to accepting a user\u2010supplied supported_type string\
    \ and the uploaded filename without enforcing real extension or MIME checks within\
    \ the upload() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote\
    \ code execution possible.\n"
