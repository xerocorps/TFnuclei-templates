  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the several of the plugin''s form parameter in versions up to, and
    including,2.0.45 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative level capabilities
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
