  description: The Echelon theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the ~/lib/admin/functions/media-upload.php
    file in versions up to, and including, [up to affected version]. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
