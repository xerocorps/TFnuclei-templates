  description: 'The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via custom text fileds in all versions up to, and including,
    4.24.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable
    when the file uploader is added to a page/post.
