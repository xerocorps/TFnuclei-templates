  description: The Read more By Adam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.8. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to execute it, via forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
