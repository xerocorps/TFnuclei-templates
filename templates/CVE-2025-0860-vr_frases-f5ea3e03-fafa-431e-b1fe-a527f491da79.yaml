  description: 'The VR-Frases (collect & share quotes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in all versions up to,
    and including, 3.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2025-22636 appears to be a duplicate of
    this issue.
