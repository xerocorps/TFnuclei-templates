    \ \u2013 Daylight Edition and LTL Freight Quotes \u2013 Day & Ross Edition plugins\

    \ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.11, 2.2.6 and 2.1.10 respectively,\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\

    \ will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
