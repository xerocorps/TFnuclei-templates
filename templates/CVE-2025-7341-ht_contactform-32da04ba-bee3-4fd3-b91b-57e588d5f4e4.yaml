  description: 'The HT Contact Form Widget For Elementor Page Builder & Gutenberg
    Blocks & Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
    due to insufficient file path validation in the temp_file_delete() function in
    all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
