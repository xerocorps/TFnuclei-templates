  description: 'The WooCommerce Eway Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This
    is due to insufficient validation on the ''order'' user-controlled key. This ensures
    that subscriptions are paid for by the subscriber as opposed to another user.
