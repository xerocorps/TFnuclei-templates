  description: 'The DZS Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 12.25 via deserialization of untrusted
    input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the
    vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another
    plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain
    is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it
    may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve
    sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
