  description: "The Hubbub Lite \u2013 Fast, Reliable Social Sharing Buttons plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 1.33.1 via deserialization of untrusted input via the 'dpsp_maybe_unserialize'\
    \ function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor\
    \ access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable\
    \ plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed\
    \ on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files,\
    \ retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.\n"
