info:
  author: Bishopfox
  description: This module provides printer-friendly versions of content, including
    send by e-mail and PDF versions. The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize the arguments
    passed to the wkhtmltopdf executable, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
    shell commands. It also doesnt sufficiently sanitize the HTML content passed to
    dompdf, allowing a privileged attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This vulnerability
    is mitigated by the fact that the site must have either the wkhtmltopdf or dompdf
    sub-modules enabled and selected as the PDF generation tool. In the case of the
    dompdf vulnerability, the attacker must be able to write content to the site.
