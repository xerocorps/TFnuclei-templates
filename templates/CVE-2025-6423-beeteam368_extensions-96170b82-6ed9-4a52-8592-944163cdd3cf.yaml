  description: 'The BeeTeam368 Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the handle_submit_upload_file()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
