  description: 'The WP-Orphanage Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the wporphanageex_menu_settings() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to escalate the privileges of
    all orphan accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
