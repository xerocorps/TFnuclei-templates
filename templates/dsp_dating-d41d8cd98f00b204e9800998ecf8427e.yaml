  description: The WPDating plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload
    in versions up to, and including, 7.1.2. This is due to missing file type validation
    on one of the plugin's functions. While the source of information claims that
    this is a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that requires tricking an administrative
    user to click a link in order to exploit the vulnerability, we believe that this
    may be exploitable by unauthenticated users as well after analyzing the provided
    proof of concepts. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    malicious files to the server.
