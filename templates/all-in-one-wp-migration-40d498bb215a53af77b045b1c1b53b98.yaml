  description: The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated
    arbitrary back-up downloads due to insufficient filename randomization that made
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to brute force back-up filenames in
    unique situations in versions up to, and including, 7.14. This would make it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to discover information from files contained in
    the back-ups that could be used to aid further attacks or lead to simply sensitive
    information disclosure.
