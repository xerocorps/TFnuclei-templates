  description: 'The Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Deletion in versions up to, and including, 2.0.12. This is due to the plugin failing
    to properly verify user input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete files on the vulnerable service.
