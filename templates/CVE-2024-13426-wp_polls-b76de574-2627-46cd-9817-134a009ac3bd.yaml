    cvss-score: 5.4
  description: 'The WP-Polls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via
    COOKIE in all versions up to, and including, 2.77.2 due to insufficient escaping
    on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
    SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries. Those queries are stored and results
    are not displayed to the attacker, which means they cannot be exploited to obtain
    any additional information about the database. However, a properly configured
    payload allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript resulting in Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting.
