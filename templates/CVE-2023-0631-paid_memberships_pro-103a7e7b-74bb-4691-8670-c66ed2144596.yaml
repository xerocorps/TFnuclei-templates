  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic
    SQL Injection via the ''membership'' shortcode in versions up to, and including,
    2.9.11 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of
    sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access, and above, to append additional
    SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
    information from the database.
