  description: 'The Alibaba Cloud RAM (Resource Access Management) password policy
    reuse is disabled, meaning users are not restricted from reusing old passwords.
    This lack of a configured password history policy increases the risk of users
    reusing weak, previously compromised, or easily guessable passwords, which could
    lead to unauthorized access.
