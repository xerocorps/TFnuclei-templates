  description: 'The WP01 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2 due to a missing capability check
    and insufficient restrictions on the make_archive() function. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to download
    and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive
    information. CVE-2025-30567 is a duplicate of this issue.
