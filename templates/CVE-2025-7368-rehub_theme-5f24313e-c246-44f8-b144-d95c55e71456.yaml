  description: 'The REHub - Price Comparison, Multi Vendor Marketplace Wordpress Theme
    theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to,
    and including, 19.9.7 via the ''ajax_action_re_getfullcontent'' function due to
    insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected posts that
    they should not have access to.
