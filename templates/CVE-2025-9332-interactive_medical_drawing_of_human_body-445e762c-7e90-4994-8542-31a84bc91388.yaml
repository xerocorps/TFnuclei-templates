  description: 'The Interactive Human Anatomy with Clickable Body Parts plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all
    versions up to, and including, 2.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
    and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
