  description: "The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request\
    \ Forgery on its /users/delete REST route in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.0.9. The route\u2019s permission_callback only verifies that the requester\
    \ is logged in, but fails to require any nonce or other proof of intent. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user accounts\
    \ via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
