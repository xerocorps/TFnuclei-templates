  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution in versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the populate_dropdown_options
    function that accepts user supplied input and passes it through call_user_func().
    This is restricted to non-parameter PHP functions like phpinfo(); since user supplied
    parameters are not passed through the function. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrative privileges, to execute code on the server.
