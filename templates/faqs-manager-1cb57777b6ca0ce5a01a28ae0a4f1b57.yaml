  description: The FAQs Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the inic_faq_settings function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily change plugin settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
