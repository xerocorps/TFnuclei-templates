  description: "The Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter \u2013 Add Image Slider, Carousel\
    \ Slider, Exit Intent Popup, Popup Modal, Coupon Popup, Post Slider Carousel plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 3.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects\
    \ multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
