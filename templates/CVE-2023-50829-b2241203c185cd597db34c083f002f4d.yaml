  description: 'The Loan Repayment Calculator and Application Form plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.9.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
    permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
    and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
