  description: The RokMicroNews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
    in versions up to, and including, 1.5 due to inclusion of a vulnerable version
    of TimThumb. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    that execute in a victim's browser. The plugin is also vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Upload, Denial of Service Attacks, and Full Path Disclosure. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    sites server which may make remote code execution possible, deny availability
    to legitimate users, and read sensitive information such as the full path of the
    WordPress installation.
