  description: 'The Popup Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Cookie Time field in versions up to, and including, 1.16.4 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers with administrative access to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
