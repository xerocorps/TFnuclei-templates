  description: "The Passwordless WP \u2013 Login with your glance or fingerprint plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
