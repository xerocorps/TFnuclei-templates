  description: 'The BuddyTask plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access
    and modification of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX endpoints
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to view, create, modify, and
    delete task boards belonging to any BuddyPress group, including private and hidden
    groups they are not members of.
