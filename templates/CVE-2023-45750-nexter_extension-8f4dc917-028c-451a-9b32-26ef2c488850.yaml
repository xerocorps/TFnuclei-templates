  description: "The Nexter Extension plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018post\u2019 and 'post_id' parameters in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 2.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
