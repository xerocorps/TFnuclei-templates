  description: Progressive web applications are web applications that load like regular
    web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline,
    push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to
    native applications. This module doesnt sufficiently protect access to the settings
    form, allowing an unauthorized malicious user to view and modify the module settings.
