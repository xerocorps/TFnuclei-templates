  description: 'The Site Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 6.2.0. This allows unauthenticated attackers
    to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution
    when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable
    configuration.
