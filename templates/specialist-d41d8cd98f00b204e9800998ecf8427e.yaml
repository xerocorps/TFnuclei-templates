  description: The Specialist theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the upload-file.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files which may execute malicious code via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
