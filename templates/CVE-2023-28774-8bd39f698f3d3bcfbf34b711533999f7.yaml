  description: 'The Review Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.6.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level
    access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations
    and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
