  description: 'The Classified Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the rtcl_ajax_thumbnail_delete function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the post thumbnail via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
