  description: 'The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation via the ''class_fma_connector.php''
    file in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.10. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions
    by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
