  description: 'The WordPress WP-Advanced-Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 via the WP_Advanced_Search_Import()
    function which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code
    on the server through a file upload. This is due to the WP_Advanced_Search_Import()
    function being hooked via an admin_post_nopriv action that is available to all
    users.
