  description: The WP Security Question plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the save() function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
