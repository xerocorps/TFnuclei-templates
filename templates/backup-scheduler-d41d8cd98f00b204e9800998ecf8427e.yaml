  description: The Backup Scheduler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up
    to, and including, 1.5.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level permissions and above, to download the logs of the plugin
    which can contain sensitive information, in addition to several other actions
    such as deleting and modifying back-ups.
