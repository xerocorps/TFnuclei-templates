  description: Fortinet remote authentication timeout functionality is recommended
    to be enabled. Lack of a set timeout can allow an attacker to act within that
    threshold if the administrator is away from the computer, thereby making it possible
    to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.
