  description: 'The Contact Form Integrated With Google Maps plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions 1.0 - 2.4 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
