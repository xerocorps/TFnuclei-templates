    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 3.3.0 via file upload due to missing validation\
    \ on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers\
    \ to download attachments for support tickets that don't belong to them. If an\
    \ admin enables tickets for guests, this can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.\n"
