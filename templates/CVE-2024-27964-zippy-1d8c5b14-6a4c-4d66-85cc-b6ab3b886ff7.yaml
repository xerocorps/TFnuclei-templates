  description: 'The Zippy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation in the ZippyCore.php file in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with editor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
