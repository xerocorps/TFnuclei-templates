  description: "The Car Dealer Automotive WordPress Theme \u2013 Responsive theme\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file\
    \ path validation in the delete_post_photo() and add_car() functions in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.6.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,\
    \ which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted\
    \ (such as wp-config.php). The add_car() function may also make it possible to\
    \ read arbitrary files.\n"
