  description: 'The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 8.5.02.005 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
