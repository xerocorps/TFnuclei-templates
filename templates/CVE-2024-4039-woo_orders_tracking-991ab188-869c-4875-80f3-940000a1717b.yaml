  description: 'The The Orders Tracking for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including,
    1.2.10. This is due to the plugin allowing users to execute an action that does
    not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. A partial patch
    was released in 1.2.10, and a complete patch was released in 1.2.11.
