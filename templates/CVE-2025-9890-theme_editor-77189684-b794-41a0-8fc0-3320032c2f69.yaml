  description: 'The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''theme_editor_theme'' page. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
