  description: 'The Images Optimize and Upload CF7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the yr_api_delete
    AJAX action available to unprivileged users in versions up to, and including,
    2.1.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary
    files. This could be used to delete the wp-config.php file that would make complete
    site takeover relatively simple for an attacker.
