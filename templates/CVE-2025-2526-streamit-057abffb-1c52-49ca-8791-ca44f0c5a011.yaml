  description: 'The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due
    to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating their
    details like email in the ''st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile'' function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user''s
    email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user''s
    password and gain access to their account.
