  description: The Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the nsc_bar_save_submitted_form_fields()
    function called via and admin_init hook in versions up to, and including, 2.10.0.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings
    and inject malicious web scripts. Please note this is still vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery attacks.
