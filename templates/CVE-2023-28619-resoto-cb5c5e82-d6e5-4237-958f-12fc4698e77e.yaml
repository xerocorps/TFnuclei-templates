  description: 'The Resoto theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
    of data due to a missing capability check on the ''activate_plugin'' function
    in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level access, and above, to use an ajax endpoint to
    activate an arbitrary plugin and hide the notice.
