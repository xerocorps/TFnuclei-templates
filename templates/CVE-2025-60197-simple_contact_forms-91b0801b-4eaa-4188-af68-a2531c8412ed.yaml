  description: 'The Simple Contact Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local
    File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server,
    allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass
    access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where
    images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and included.
