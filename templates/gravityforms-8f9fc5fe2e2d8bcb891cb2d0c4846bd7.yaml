  description: 'WordPress Plugin Gravity Forms is prone to a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker
    may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an
    unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker
    to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. WordPress
    Plugin Gravity Forms version 2.0.6.5 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be
    affected.
