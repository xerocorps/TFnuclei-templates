  description: 'The Biteship plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via plugin settings in versions up to, and including, 2.2.27 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
