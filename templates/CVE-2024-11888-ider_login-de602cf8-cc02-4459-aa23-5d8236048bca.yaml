  description: 'The IDer Login for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''ider_login_button'' shortcode
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This affects
    version 2.1, but was also patched in version 2.1 - a new version was not released
    with the patch.
