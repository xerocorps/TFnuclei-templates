  description: 'The Icegram Express - Email Subscribers, Newsletters and Marketing
    Automation Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions
    up to, and including, 5.9.10. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
    that a user is authorized to perform an action in the `run_action_scheduler_task`
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute scheduled
    actions early or repeatedly by guessing action IDs, potentially triggering email
    sends, maintenance tasks, or other privileged operations, causing unexpected state
    changes and resource usage.
