  description: 'The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the download-add.php file
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.11. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
