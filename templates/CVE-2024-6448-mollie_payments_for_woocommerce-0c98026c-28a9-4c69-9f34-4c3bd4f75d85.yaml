  description: 'The Mollie Payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to information exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.7.0. This is due
    to the error reporting being enabled by default in multiple plugin files. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the full path to instances,
    which they may be able to use in combination with other vulnerabilities or to
    simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information is of very limited
    use.
