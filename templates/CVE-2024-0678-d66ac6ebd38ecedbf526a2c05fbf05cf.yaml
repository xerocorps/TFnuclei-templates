  description: 'The Order Delivery Date for WP e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''available-days-tf'' parameter
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. Please note this only affects the version of the "order-delivery-date" plugin
    for WP Ecommerce which was hosted in the WordPress repository and is discontinued
    now. The version of the plugin hosted off of the repository titled ''Order Delivery
    Date'' for WooCommerce is not affected.
