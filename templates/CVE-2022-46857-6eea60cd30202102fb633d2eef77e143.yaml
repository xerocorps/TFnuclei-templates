  description: 'The SiteAlert (Formerly WP Health) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.7. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
