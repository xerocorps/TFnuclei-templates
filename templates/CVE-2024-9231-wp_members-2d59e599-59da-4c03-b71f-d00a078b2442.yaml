  description: 'The WP-Members Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate
    escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.9.5. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
