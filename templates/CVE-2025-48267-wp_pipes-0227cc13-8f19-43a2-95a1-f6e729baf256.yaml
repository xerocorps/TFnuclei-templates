  description: 'The WP Pipes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation via the delete_template() function
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
    code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
