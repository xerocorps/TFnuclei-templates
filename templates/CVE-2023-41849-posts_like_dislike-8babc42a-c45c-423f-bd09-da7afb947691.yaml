  description: 'The Posts Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings
    function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as
    a subscriber, to reset the plugin''s settings. Note: this issue was only partially
    patched in 1.1.1 as the nonce is still visible to subscriber-level users.
