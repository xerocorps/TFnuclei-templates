  description: 'The AffiEasy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to plugin improperly
    releasing the tagged and patched version of the plugin - the vulnerable version
    is used as the core files, while the patched version was included in a ''trunk''
    folder. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety
    of actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
