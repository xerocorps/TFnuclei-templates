  description: The Peter's Math Anti-Spam Spinoff plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to CAPTCHA Bypass in versions up to 1.0.0. This is due to the plugin generating
    audio CAPTCHA clips by concatenating static audio files without any additional
    distortion. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the
    Captcha Verification by reading certain bytes from the generated clip.
