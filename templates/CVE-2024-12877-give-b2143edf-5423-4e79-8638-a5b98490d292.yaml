  description: "The GiveWP \u2013 Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 3.19.2 via deserialization of untrusted input from the donation form\
    \ like 'firstName'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject\
    \ a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete\
    \ arbitrary files on the server that makes remote code execution possible. Please\
    \ note this was only partially patched in 3.19.3, a fully sufficient patch was\
    \ not released until 3.19.4. However, another CVE was assigned by another CNA\
    \ for version 3.19.3 so we will leave this as affecting 3.19.2 and before. We\
    \ have recommended the vendor use JSON encoding to prevent any further deserialization\
    \ vulnerabilities from being present.\n"
