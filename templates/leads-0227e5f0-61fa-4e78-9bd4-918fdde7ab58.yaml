  description: 'The WordPress Leads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on multiple functions in versions up
    to, and including, 1.6.2. This makes it possible for unathenticated attackers
    to include malicious content in Leads, which may be executed upon viewing in the
    dashboard at the current logged-in user''s level of permissions.
