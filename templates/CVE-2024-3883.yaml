  description: 'The 3D FlipBook plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the Bookmark URL field in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.4
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
