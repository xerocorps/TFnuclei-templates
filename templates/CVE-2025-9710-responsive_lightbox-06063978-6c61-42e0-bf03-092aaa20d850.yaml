  description: 'The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.2 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
