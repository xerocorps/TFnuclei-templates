  description: 'Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks
    WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker
    can craft malicious HTTP requests and obtain any file on the file system that
    is also accessible to the process in which the Spring application is running.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can exploit path traversal to read any file accessible
    to the Spring application process, potentially exposing sensitive configuration
    files, credentials, and application data.
