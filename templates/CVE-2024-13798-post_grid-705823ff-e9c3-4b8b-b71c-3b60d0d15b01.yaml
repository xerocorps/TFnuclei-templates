  description: "The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks \u2013 ComboBlocks plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to unauthorized order creation in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.3.5. This is due to insufficient verification on form fields. This makes it\
    \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new orders for products and\
    \ mark them as paid without actually completing a payment.\n"
