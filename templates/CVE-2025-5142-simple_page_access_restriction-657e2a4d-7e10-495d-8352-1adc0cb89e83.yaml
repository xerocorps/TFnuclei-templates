  description: "The Simple Page Access Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.31.\
    \ This is due to missing nonce validation and capability checks in the settings\
    \ save handler in the settings.php script. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to (1) enable or disable access protection on all post types or taxonomies,\
    \ (2) force every new page/post to be public or private, regardless of meta-box\
    \ settings, (3) cause a silent wipe of all plugin data when it\u2019s later removed,\
    \ or (4) to conduct URL redirection attacks via a forged request granted they\
    \ can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on\
    \ a link.\n"
