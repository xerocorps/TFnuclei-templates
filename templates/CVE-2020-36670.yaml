  description: The NEX-Forms. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure
    and modification of data in versions up to, and including 7.7.1 due to missing
    capability checks on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber level permissions and above to invoke these functions
    which can be used to perform actions like modify form submission records, deleting
    files, sending test emails, modifying plugin settings, and more.
