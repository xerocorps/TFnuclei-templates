  description: 'The Create with Code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
