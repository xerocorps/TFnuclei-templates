  description: 'The WP Easy Gallery for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
