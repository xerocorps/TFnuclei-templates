  description: 'The WP Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via some of its settings parameters in versions up to, and including,
    5.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
    above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
    accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
