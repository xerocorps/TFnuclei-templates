  description: 'The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag
    & Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/fluentform/v1/managers REST
    API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.16. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to grant users with Fluent Form management permissions
    which gives them access to all of the plugin''s settings and features. This also
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete manager accounts.
