  description: 'The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via shortcode in versions up to, and including, 4.2.1 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
