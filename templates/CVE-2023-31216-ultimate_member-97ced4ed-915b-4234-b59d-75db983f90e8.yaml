  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the duplicate_form function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate forms created with the plugin via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
