  description: 'The WP Gallery Metabox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the gallery_metabox() function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
