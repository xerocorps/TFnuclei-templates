  description: 'The Image Hover Effects Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Media Image URL value that can be added
    to an Image Hover in versions up to, and including, 9.7.3 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. By default, the plugin only allows administrators
    access to edit Image Hovers, however, if a site admin makes the plugin''s features
    available to lower privileged users through the ''Who Can Edit?'' setting then
    this can be exploited by those users.
