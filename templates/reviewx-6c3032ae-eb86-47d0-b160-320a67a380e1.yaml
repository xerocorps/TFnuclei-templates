  description: 'The WooCommerce Reviews Plugin with Multi-criteria Rating by ReviewX
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before
    1.2.9. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/app/Controllers/Storefront/ReviewxPublic.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized
    AJAX actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
