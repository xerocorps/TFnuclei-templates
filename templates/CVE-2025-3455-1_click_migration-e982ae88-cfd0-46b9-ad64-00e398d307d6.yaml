  description: "The 1 Click WordPress Migration Plugin \u2013 100% FREE for a limited\
    \ time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data\
    \ due to a missing capability check on the 'start_restore' function in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected\
    \ site's server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
