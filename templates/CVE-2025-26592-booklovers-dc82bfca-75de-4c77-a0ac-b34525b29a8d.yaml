  description: 'Multiple themes for WordPress by axiomthemes, ThemeRex, and AncoraThemes
    are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in various versions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the
    server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
    to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in
    cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
