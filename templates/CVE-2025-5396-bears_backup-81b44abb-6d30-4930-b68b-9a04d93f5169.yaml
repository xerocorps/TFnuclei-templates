  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2025-5396
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 9.8
  description: 'The Bears Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to the bbackup_ajax_handle()
    function not having a capability check, nor validating user supplied input passed
    directly to call_user_func(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to execute code on the server which can be leverage to inject backdoors or create
    new administrative user accounts to name a few things. On WordPress sites running
    the Alone theme versions 7.8.4 and older, this can be chained with CVE-2025-5394
    to install the Bears Backup plugin and achieve the same impact.
