  description: 'The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
    mj_smgt_load_documets_new() and mj_smgt_load_documets() functions in all versions
    up to, and including, 91.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Student-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
