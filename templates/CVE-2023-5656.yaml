  description: 'The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    use of AJAX actions due to missing capability checks on the corresponding functions
    in versions up to, and including, 4.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform some of those actions that were intended for higher privileged
    users. This vulnerability is the same as CVE-2023-5533 but was reintroduced in
    version 4.9.2.
