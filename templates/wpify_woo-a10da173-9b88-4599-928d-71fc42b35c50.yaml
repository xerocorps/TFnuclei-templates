  description: 'The WPify Woo Czech plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of ''$_SERVER[''PHP_SELF'']'' with insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping in versions up to, and including, 3.5.6.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
