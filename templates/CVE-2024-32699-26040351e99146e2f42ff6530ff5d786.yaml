  description: 'The YITH WooCommerce Compare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.37.0. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add/remove things from a product
    compare via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is marked as informational
    as there is no true security impact.
