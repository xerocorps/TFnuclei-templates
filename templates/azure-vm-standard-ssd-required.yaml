  description: 'Ensure that your Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs) are using
    Standard SSD disk volumes instead of Premium SSD volumes for cost-effective storage
    that fits a broad range of workloads from web servers to enterprise applications
    that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels. Unless you are running
    mission-critical applications or performance sensitive workloads that need more
    than 6000 IOPS or 750 MiB/s of throughput per VM disk volume, Cloud Conformity
    recommends converting your Premium SSD volumes to Standard SSD in order to lower
    the cost of your Azure monthly bill.

    '
  impact: 'Using Premium SSD volumes when not required can significantly increase
    the cost without providing necessary benefits for non-critical workloads, leading
    to inefficient resource utilization and budget overruns.

    '
  name: Azure VM Premium SSD Not Required
  reference:
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types
  remediation: 'Convert any Premium SSD volumes to Standard SSD unless the workload
    requires high performance disk specifications. This can be achieved through Azure''s
    portal or via CLI commands.
