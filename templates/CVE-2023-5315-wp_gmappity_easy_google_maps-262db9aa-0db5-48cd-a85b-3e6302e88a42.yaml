  description: 'The Google Maps made Simple plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    SQL Injection via the plugin''s shortcode in versions up to, and including, 0.6
    due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
    preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with subscriber-level and above permissions to append additional SQL
    queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database.
