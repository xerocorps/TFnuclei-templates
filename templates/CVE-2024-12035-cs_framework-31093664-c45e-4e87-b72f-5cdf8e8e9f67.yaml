  description: 'The CS Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the cs_widget_file_delete()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 6.9. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
