  description: 'The WooCommerce Purchase Orders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_file()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
