  description: 'The POST SMTP Mailer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. This is due to incorrect
    nonce validation on the resend_email() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to resend emails to an arbitrary email address via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site user with the manage_postman_smtp capability into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.  An attacker could leverage this
    to resend a password reset email to their own account and compromise a site administrators
    account.
