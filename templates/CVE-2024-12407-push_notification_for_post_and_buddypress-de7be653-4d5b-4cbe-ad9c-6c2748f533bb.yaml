    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The Push Notification for Post and BuddyPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ''pushnotificationid''
    parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.07 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
