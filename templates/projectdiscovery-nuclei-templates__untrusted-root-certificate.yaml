  description: 'A root certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted certificate
    authority that acts as a basis for other digital certificates. An untrusted root
    certificate is a certificate that is issued by an authority that is not trusted
    by the computer, and therefore cannot be used to authenticate websites or other
    digital certificates.
