  description: "The Contest Gallery \u2013 Upload, Vote & Sell with PayPal and Stripe\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple\
    \ form field parameters in all versions up to, and including, 27.0.2. This is\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level\
    \ access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
