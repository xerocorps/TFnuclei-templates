  description: 'The Single Post Exporter WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 does not have
    CSRF checks when saving its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged
    in admin change them via a CSRF attack and give access to the export feature to
    any role such as subscriber. Subscriber users would then be able to export an
    arbitrary post/page (such as private and password protected) via a direct URL.
