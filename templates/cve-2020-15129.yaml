  description: There exists a potential open redirect vulnerability in Traefik's handling
    of the X-Forwarded-Prefix header. Active Exploitation of this issue is unlikely
    as it would require active header injection, however the Traefik team may want
    to address this issue nonetheless to prevent abuse in e.g. cache poisoning scenarios.
