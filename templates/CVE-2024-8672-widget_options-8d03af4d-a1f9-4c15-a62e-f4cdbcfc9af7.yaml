  description: "The Widget Options \u2013 The #1 WordPress Widget & Block Control\
    \ Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 4.0.7 via the display logic functionality that extends\
    \ several page builders. This is due to the plugin allowing users to supply input\
    \ that will be passed through eval() without any filtering or capability checks.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access\
    \ and above, to execute code on the server. Special note: We suggested the vendor\
    \ implement an allowlist of functions and limit the ability to execute commands\
    \ to just administrators, however, they did not take our advice. We are considering\
    \ this patched, however, we believe it could still be further hardened and there\
    \ may be residual risk with how the issue is currently patched.\n"
