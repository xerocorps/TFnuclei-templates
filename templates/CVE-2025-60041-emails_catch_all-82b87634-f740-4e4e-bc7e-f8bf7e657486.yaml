  description: 'The Emails Catch All plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation via email log exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.3.
    This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to email logs. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to trigger a password reset email that gets logged for all users, including
    administrators, and leverage that to reset the user''s password and gain access
    to their account.
