  description: 'WordPress Core in versions up to 6.0.3 had a weakness in how Share
    User Instances were handled. This fix appears to have been necessary to safely
    use the wp_set_current_user( 0 ); method to patch the previously mentioned XSS
    and CSRF in wp-mail.php and wp-trackback.php vulnerabilities. The previous functionality
    may have resulted in third party plugins or themes using the wp_set_current_user
    function in a way that could lead to privilege escalation and users being able
    to perform more actions than originally intended.
