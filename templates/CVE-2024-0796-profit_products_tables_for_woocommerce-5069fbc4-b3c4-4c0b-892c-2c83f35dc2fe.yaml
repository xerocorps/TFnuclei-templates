  description: 'The Active Products Tables for WooCommerce. Professional products
    tables for WooCommerce store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6.1. This is due to
    missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions corresponding to AJAX
    actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those
    functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
