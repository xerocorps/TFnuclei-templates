    cvss-score: 8.1
  description: 'The Product Stock Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions such as af_sm_set_checkbox_status
    in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those actions
    and make changes they are unauthorized to do so. Furthermore, proper Cross-Site
    Request Forgery protection is missing. This allows unauthenticated attackers to
    invoke those actions, via forged request granted they can trick a user into clicking
    on a link. The af_sm_set_checkbox_status AJAX action can be used to change arbitrary
    options on the site, which can be used to register administrative user accounts
    on the site.
