  description: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirects
    in versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 This is due to insufficient redirect location
    validation which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trick victims
    into accessing malicious sites granted they can trick the victim into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
