  description: "The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018section_id\u2019 parameter in versions up\
    \ to, and including, 5.2.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
