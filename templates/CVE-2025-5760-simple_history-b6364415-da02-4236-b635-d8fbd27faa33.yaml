  description: "The Simple History plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive\
    \ data exposure via Detective Mode due to improper sanitization within the append_debug_info_to_context()\
    \ function in versions prior to 5.8.1. When Detective Mode is enabled, the plugin\u2019\
    s logger captures the entire contents of $_POST (and sometimes raw request bodies\
    \ or $_GET) without redacting any password\u2010related keys. As a result, whenever\
    \ a user submits a login form, whether via native wp_login or a third\u2010party\
    \ login widget, their actual password is written in clear text into the logs.\
    \ An authenticated attacker or any user whose actions generate a login event will\
    \ have their password recorded; an administrator (or anyone with database read\
    \ access) can then read those logs and retrieve every captured password.\n"
