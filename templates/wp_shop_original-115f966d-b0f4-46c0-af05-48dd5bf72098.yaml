  description: "The WP Shop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request\
    \ Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018wpshop_email\u2019 parameter\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 3.4.3.18 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping and missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute\
    \ if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking\
    \ on a link.\n"
