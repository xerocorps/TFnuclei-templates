  description: 'The Himer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the wpqa_add_group_user AJAX action. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send user invites to private groups
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
