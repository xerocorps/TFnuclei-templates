  description: 'The Listingo theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation via one of its AJAX actions in versions up
    to, and including, 3.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
