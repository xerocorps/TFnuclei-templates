  description: 'IBM Data Risk Manager versions 2.0.1 through 2.0.6 are vulnerable
    to authentication bypass when configured with SAML authentication. A remote attacker
    can bypass security restrictions by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to
    the SAML idpSelection endpoint, allowing them to bypass the authentication process
    and gain full administrative access to the system.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication via SAML endpoint and
    gain full administrative access to IBM Data Risk Manager, compromising all managed
    data risk information.
