  description: 'The WP Quick Setup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    plugin and theme installation due to a missing capability check on a function
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins
    and themes which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
