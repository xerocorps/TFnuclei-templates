  description: 'The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the woffice_file_manager_delete()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.26. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete
    arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
    when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
