  description: 'The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.6.6 (Free) and
    5.6.4 (Premium). This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when deleting
    files uploaded during checkout. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to delete those files, via forged request granted they can trick a site Shop Manager
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
