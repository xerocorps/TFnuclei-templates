  description: This module enables you to display a Bible on your website. Users can
    associate notes with a Bible version. This module has a vulnerability that would
    allow an attacker to wipe out, update or read notes from other users with a carefully
    crafted title. A user must have the Access Bible content privilege, which is most
    likely the default if you have enabled this module. The code appeared to allow
    other SQL injection vulnerabilities as well. Many lines of code were rewritten
    to make this module more secure. Therefore, even if you did not give users the
    Access Bible content privilege, there may have been other SQL vulnerabilities
    which could have been exploited.
