  description: 'The WP Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to a missing capability check and missing file type validation
    in the via the ~/class-wp-job-manager-ajax.php file in versions up to, and including,
    1.26.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
