  description: 'The BookIt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    in versions up to, and including, 2.3.7. This is due to insufficient verification
    on the user being supplied during booking an appointment through the plugin. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user
    on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.
