  description: 'The Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via parameter keys through accordion imports in versions up to, and
    including, 2.2.40 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for attackers with administrative privileges to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
