  description: 'The YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.0 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
