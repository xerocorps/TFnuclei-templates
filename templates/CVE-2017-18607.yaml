  description: The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
    in versions up to, and including, 5.1.4. This is due to missing nonce validation
    on the fusion_builder_importer() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to trigger the importer and upload arbitrary files via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
