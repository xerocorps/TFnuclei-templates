  description: The Currency Switcher for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate
    escaping on the URL in versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
