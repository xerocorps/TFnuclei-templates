  description: 'The Woffice CRM theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.21. This is due to a misconfiguration
    of excluded roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to register with an Administrator role if a custom login form is being
    used. This can be combined with CVE-2025-2797 to bypass the user approval process
    if an Administrator can be tricked into taking an action such as clicking a link.
