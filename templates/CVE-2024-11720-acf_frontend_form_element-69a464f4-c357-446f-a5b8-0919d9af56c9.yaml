  description: 'The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via submission forms in all versions up to, and
    including, 3.24.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
    the new Taxonomy form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This is only exploitable when lower-level users have been granted
    access to submit specific forms, which is disabled by default.
