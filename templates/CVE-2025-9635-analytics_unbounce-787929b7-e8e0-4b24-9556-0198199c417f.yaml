  description: 'The Analytics Reduce Bounce Rate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.3. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the unbounce_options function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify Google Analytics
    tracking settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
