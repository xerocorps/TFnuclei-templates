  description: 'The Flower Delivery by Florist One plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''flower-delivery'' shortcode
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
