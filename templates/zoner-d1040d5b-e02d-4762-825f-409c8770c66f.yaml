  description: 'The Zoner - Real Estate theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.1 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    and unauthenticated attackers (NOTE: depending on which type of XSS the attacker
    is performing) to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
