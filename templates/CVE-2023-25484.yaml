  description: The Simple Yearly Archive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 2.1.8
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
