  description: 'The Poll, Survey & Quiz Maker Plugin by Opinion Stage plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a misconfigured capability
    check on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 19.9.0. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and
    above, to change the email address for the account connection, and disconnect
    the plugin. Previously created content will still be displayed and functional
    if the account is disconnected.
