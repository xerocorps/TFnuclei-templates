  description: "The Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 8.4 via several\
    \ of the plugin's widgets through the 'style' attribute. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP\
    \ code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive\
    \ data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D\
    \ file types can be uploaded and included. CVE-2024-37547 is likely a duplicate\
    \ of this issue.\n"
