  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-10633
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
    cvss-score: 7.3
  description: 'The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including,
    8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including,
    31.8.0 (Agency). This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action
    that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE:
    The three variations of this software (Business, Developer, and Agency) share
    the same plugin slug, so you may get an alert even if you are running the latest
    version of any of the pieces of software. In these cases it is safe to dismiss
    the notice once you''ve confirmed your site is on a patched version of the applicable
    software.
