  description: 'The EmpowerWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.21. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the empower_admin_ajax_welcome_notice_dismiss function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss a notice via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
