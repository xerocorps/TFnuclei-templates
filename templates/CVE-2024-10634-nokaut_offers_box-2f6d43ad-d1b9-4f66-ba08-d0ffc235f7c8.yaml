  description: 'The Nokaut Offers Box plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
