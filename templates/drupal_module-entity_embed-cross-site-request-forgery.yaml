  description: This advisory addresses a similar issue to Drupal core - Moderately
    critical - Cross Site Request Forgery - SA-CORE-2021-006. The Entity Embed module
    provides a filter to allow embedding entities in content fields. In certain circumstances,
    the filter could allow an unprivileged user to inject HTML into a page when it
    is accessed by a trusted user with permission to embed entities. In some cases,
    this could lead to cross-site scripting.
