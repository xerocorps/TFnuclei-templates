  description: 'The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.90. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the Save function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make changes to invoices via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
