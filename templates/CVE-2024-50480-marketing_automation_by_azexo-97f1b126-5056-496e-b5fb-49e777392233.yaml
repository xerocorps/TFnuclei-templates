  description: 'The Marketing Automation by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions

    with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
