  description: 'The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This is due to missing nonce
    validation on the ''enable_safe_mode'' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to enable safe mode, which disables all other plugins, via a forged
    request if they can successfully trick an administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. A warning message about safe mode is displayed to
    the admin, which can be easily disabled.
