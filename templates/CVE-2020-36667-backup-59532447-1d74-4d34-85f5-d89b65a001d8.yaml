  description: "The JetBackup \u2013 WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to unauthorized back-up location changes in versions up to, and\
    \ including 1.4.1 due to a lack of proper capability checking on the backup_guard_cloud_dropbox,\
    \ backup_guard_cloud_gdrive, and backup_guard_cloud_oneDrive functions. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions, such as a\
    \ subscriber to change to location of back-ups and potentially steal sensitive\
    \ information from them.\n"
