  description: 'The WP 2FA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information
    Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to the use of a linear-time
    comparison operator when comparing token hashes. This allows an attacker to gain
    information about authentication tokens by observing small time differences in
    server response times. This is a vulnerability that is generally not realistically
    exploitable over the internet due to other factors that will have a greater influence
    on response times.
