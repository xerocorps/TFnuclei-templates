  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-13537
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    cvss-score: 5.3
  description: 'The C9 Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.7. This is due the plugin containing
    a publicly accessible composer-setup.php file with error display enabled. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the
    web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed
    is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for
    damage to an affected website.
