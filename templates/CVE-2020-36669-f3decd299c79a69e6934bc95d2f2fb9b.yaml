  description: "The JetBackup \u2013 WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including\
    \ 1.3.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the backup_guard_get_import_backup()\
    \ function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary\
    \ files to the vulnerable site's server via a forged request, granted they can\
    \ trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a\
    \ link.\n"
