  description: The Real Estate 7 WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to both
    Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct Object Reference, and
    Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.9.4 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, along with exposure of email
    addresses in hidden form fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page, and view sensitive information including order information,
    usernames, and email addresses.
