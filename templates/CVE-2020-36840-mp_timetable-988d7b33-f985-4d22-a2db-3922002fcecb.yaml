  description: 'The Timetable and Event Schedule by MotoPress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the
    wp_ajax_route_url() function called via a nopriv AJAX action in versions up to,
    and including, 2.3.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    call that function and perform a wide variety of actions such as including random
    template, injecting malicious web scripts, and more.
