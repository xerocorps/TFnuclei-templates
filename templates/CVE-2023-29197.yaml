  description: "guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in\
    \ PHP. Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could\
    \ sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification\
    \ states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the\
    \ wild will also accept \n\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where the\
    \ fix was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5.\
    \ There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to\
    \ upgrade.\nWhile some WordPress plugins and themes may be using this library,\
    \ it does not make them vulnerable to exploitation."
