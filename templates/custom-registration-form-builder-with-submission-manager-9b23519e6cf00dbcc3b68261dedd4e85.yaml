  description: 'The RegistrationMagic - Custom Registration Forms plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the ''rm_form_id'' field in versions
    up to, and including, 3.8.0.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
    parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database.
