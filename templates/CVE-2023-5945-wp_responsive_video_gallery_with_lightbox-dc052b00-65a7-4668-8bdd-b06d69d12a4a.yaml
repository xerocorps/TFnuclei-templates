  description: 'The video carousel slider with lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in version 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the responsive_video_gallery_with_lightbox_video_management_func()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete videos
    hosted from the video slider via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
