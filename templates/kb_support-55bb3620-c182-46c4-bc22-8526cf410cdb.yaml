  description: 'The KB Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to user data retrieval
    in versions up to, and including, 1.5.88. This is due to to a missing capability
    check on the kbs_ajax_get_customer_data() function. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to execute
    the function and retrieve limited user data like email, name, phone, and url.
