  description: 'The Bread & Butter: Gate content + Capture leads + Collect first-party
    data + Nurture with Ai agents plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.11.1374. This is due to
    missing or incorrect nonce validation on the uploadImage() function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files that make
    remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
