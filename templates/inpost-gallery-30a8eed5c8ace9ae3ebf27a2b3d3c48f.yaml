  description: "The InPost Gallery Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File\
    \ Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 via the popup_shortcode_key\
    \ parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary\
    \ files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included."
