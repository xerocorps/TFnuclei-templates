  author: Bishopfox
  description: The session limit module enables a site administrator to set a policy
    around the number of active sessions users of the site may have. This is typically
    set to one so that you can only be logged in once with the same user account.
    In one configuration of the module, when a user logs in with another session elsewhere
    already active, the module asks the user which session should be closed before
    they can proceed with login. The module does not sufficiently tokenise the list
    of sessions so that the users session keys can be found through inspection of
    the form. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must already
    be able to intercept the contents of the HTML page to exploit the issue. That
    ability to intercept may come from Cross Site Scripting.  This makes a Cross Site
    Scripting vulnerability worse than it would normally be.
