  description: "The The7 \u2014 Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress theme\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'url' attribute\
    \ within the plugin's Icon and Heading widgets in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 11.13.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
