  description: 'The Integrations of Zoho CRM with Elementor form plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This
    is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url supplied. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites
    if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
