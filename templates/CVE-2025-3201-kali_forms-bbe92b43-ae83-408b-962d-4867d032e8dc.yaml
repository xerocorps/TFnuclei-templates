  description: "The Contact Form builder with drag & drop for WordPress \u2013 Kali\
    \ Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 2.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
