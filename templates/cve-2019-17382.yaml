  description: An issue was discovered in zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=1
    in Zabbix through 4.4. An attacker can bypass the login page and access the dashboard
    page, and then create a Dashboard, Report, Screen, or Map without any Username/Password
    (i.e., anonymously). All created elements (Dashboard/Report/Screen/Map) are accessible
    by other users and by an admin.
