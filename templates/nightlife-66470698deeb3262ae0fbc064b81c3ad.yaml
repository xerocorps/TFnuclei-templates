  description: The Nightlife Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation via the upload-file.php file in all known
    versions. This makes it possible for [authentication-level] attackers unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
