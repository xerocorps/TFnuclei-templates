  description: 'The IGIT Related Posts With Thumb Image After Posts plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,  4.5.3
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
