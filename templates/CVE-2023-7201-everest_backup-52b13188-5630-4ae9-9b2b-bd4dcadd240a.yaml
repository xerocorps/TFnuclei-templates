  description: 'The Everest Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the backup file upload functionality
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
