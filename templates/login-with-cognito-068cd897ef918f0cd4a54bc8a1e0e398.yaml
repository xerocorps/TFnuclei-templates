  description: The Login with Cognito plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including 1.4.6. This is due to the plugin accepting
    a user supplied email address that is passed to wp_set_auth_cookie() with no further
    identity validation to verify that the email supplied belongs to the user trying
    to log in with that email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to log in as a site administrator granted they have access to a site
    admin's email address.
