  description: 'The Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
    including, 4.9.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ''ays_sccp_results_export_file''
    AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive
    plugin data including email addresses, IP addresses, physical addresses, user
    IDs, and other user information via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The exported
    data is stored in a publicly accessible file, allowing attackers to receive the
    sensitive information even though they are not authenticated.
