  description: "The Quiz And Survey Master \u2013 Best Quiz, Exam and Survey Plugin\
    \ for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.2 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected\
    \ page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html\
    \ has been disabled.\n"
