  description: "The Maspik \u2013 Advanced Spam Protection plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings\
    \ via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
