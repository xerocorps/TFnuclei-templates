  description: 'The Competition Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete competitions granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
