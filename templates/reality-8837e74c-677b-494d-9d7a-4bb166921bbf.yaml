  description: 'The Reality theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the property and user pages in versions up to, and including, 2.3.0
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
