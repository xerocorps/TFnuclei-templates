  description: 'The WP News plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''plugin_activation'' function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed
    (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
