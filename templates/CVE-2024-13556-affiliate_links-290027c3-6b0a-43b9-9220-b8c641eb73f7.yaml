  description: 'The Affiliate Links: WordPress Plugin for Link Cloaking and Link Management
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up
    to, and including, 3.0.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from an file export.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No
    known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability
    has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed
    on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete
    arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP
    chain present.
