  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the pmpro_page_save() function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to save pages via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
