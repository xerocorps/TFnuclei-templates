  description: 'The Library File Manager WordPress plugin before 5.2.3 is using an
    outdated version of the elFinder library, which is known to be affected by security
    issues (CVE-2021-32682), and does not have any authorisation as well as CSRF checks
    in its connector AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber
    to call it. Furthermore, as the options passed to the elFinder library does not
    restrict any file type, users with a role as low as subscriber can Create/Upload/Delete
    Arbitrary files and folders.
