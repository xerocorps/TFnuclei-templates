  description: 'The Glance That plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
