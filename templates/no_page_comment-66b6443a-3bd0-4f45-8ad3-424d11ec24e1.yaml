  description: 'The No Page Comment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via $_SERVER[''REQUEST_URI''], which is echoed to a form
    in versions up to, and including, 1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is not likely to be
    exploitable in modern browsers.
