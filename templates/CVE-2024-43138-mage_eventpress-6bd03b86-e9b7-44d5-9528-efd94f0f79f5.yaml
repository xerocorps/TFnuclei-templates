  description: "The Event Manager and Tickets Selling Plugin for WooCommerce \u2013\
    \ WpEvently \u2013 WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local\
    \ File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.1 via the 'mep_event_template'\
    \ parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing\
    \ the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
