  description: 'The Lifeline Donation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This is due to insufficient verification
    on the user being supplied during the checkout through the plugin. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the
    site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.
