  description: "The LazyTasks \u2013 Project & Task Management with Collaboration,\
    \ Kanban and Gantt Chart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation\
    \ via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.29. This is due\
    \ to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity via the 'wp-json/lazytasks/api/v1/user/role/edit/'\
    \ REST API endpoint prior to updating their details like email address. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses,\
    \ including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and\
    \ gain access to their account. It is also possible for attackers to abuse this\
    \ endpoint to grant users with access to additional roles within the plugin\n"
