  description: 'The Wise Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3. This is due to missing nonce
    validation on several functions such as resetAnonymousCounterAction, resetSettingsAction,
    deleteAllUsersAndMessagesAction, deleteBanAction, addBanAction, clearChannelAction,
    deleteChannelAction, backupChannelAction, and more. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to control the plugin''s setttings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
