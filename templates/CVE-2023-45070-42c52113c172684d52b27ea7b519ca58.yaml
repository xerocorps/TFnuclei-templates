  description: 'The Form Maker by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via a few parameters related to searching in versions up
    to, and including, 1.15.18 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
