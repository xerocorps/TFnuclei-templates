  description: 'The PegaPoll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
    of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged
    to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration
    for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
