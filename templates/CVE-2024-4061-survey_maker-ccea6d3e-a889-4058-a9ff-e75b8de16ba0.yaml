  description: "The Survey Maker \u2013 Customer Satisfaction Survey, Chat Survey,\
    \ Calculaton Form, Payment Surveys plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 4.2.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
