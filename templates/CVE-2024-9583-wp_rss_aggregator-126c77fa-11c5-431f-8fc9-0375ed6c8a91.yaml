  description: "The RSS Aggregator \u2013 RSS Import, News Feeds, Feed to Post, and\
    \ Autoblogging plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of functionality\
    \ due to a missing capability check on the wprss_ajax_send_premium_support function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 4.23.12. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to send premium support requests\
    \ with an attacker-controlled subject line and email address to support allowing\
    \ them to impersonate the site owner. License information may also be leaked.\n"
