  description: "The Photo Gallery, Sliders, Proofing and Themes \u2013 NextGEN Gallery\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.59.12 via the 'template' shortcode parameter. This is due\
    \ to insufficient path validation that allows absolute paths to be provided. This\
    \ makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access\
    \ and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, bypassing\
    \ web server restrictions like .htaccess. Successful exploitation could lead to\
    \ information disclosure, code execution in the WordPress context, and potential\
    \ remote code execution if combined with arbitrary file upload capabilities.\n"
