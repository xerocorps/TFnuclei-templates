  description: 'The Spam Free WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to full
    path disclosure in versions up to, and including, 1.9.3 via various files. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data which
    consists of full application path details that can be used to exploit additional
    vulnerabilities that may require that information.
