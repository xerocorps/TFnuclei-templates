  description: "The User Profile Builder \u2013 Beautiful User Registration Forms,\
    \ User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 3.13.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\
    \ on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The issue\
    \ was partially patched in version 3.13.6 of the plugin, and fully patched in\
    \ 3.13.7.\n"
