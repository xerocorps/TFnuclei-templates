  description: 'The Analytify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability and nonce checks on the analytify_delete_cache
    function in versions up to, and including, 4.2.2 . This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete
    the cache of the plugin and also allows unauthenticated attackers to delete the
    plugin cache via forged request, granted they can trick a subscriber or higher
    into clicking on a link. Version 4.2.3 adds a nonce check to the function, which
    addressed the Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability and makes exploitation
    impractical for lower-level accounts.
