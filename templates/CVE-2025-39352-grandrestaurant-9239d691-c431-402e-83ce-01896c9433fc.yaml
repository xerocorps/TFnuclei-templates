  description: 'The Grand Restaurant WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to
    a missing capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including,
    7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary
    option values on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option
    that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users.
