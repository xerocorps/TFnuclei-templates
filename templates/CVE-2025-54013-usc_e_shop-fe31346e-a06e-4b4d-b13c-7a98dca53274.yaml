  description: 'The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.16
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
