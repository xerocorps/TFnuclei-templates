  description: 'The ALD Dropping and Fulfillment for AliExpress and WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and
    including, 1.0.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several
    functions such as the ''update_ali_order_id'', ''ob_get_clean'', and ''get_ali_order_detail''
    functions to name a few. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to retrieve order information or possibly make (minor) changes to an order via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
