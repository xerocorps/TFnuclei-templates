  description: 'The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the ''save_settings'' function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to modify the theme''s settings, including enabling
    a setting which allows lower-privileged users such as contributors to perform
    code execution, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
