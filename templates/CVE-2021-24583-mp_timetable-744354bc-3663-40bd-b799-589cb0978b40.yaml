  description: 'The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.2 does
    not have proper access control when deleting a timeslot, allowing any user with
    the edit_posts capability (contributor+) to delete arbitrary timeslot from any
    events. Furthermore, no CSRF check is in place as well, allowing such attack to
    be performed via CSRF against a logged in with such capability
