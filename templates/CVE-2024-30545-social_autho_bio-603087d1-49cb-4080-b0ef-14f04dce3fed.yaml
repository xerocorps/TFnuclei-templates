  description: 'The Social Author Bio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The
    impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
