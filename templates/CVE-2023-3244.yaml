  description: 'The Comments Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings
    function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as
    a subscriber, to reset the plugin''s settings. NOTE: After attempting to contact
    the developer with no response, and reporting this to the WordPress plugin''s
    team 30 days ago we are disclosing this issue as it still is not updated.
