  description: 'The Th Shop Mania theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the th_shop_mania_install_and_activate_callback()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary
    plugins which can be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities and achieve remote
    code execution and privilege escalation.
