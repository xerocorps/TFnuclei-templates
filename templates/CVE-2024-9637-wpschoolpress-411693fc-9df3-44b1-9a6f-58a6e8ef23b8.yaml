  description: "The School Management System \u2013 WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 2.2.10. This is due to the plugin not properly validating\
    \ a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it\
    \ possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to\
    \ change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage\
    \ that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.\n"
