  description: 'The Redirect Redirection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the bulkDelete function
    called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access, and above,
    to bulk delete redirect rules.
