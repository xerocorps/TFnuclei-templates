  description: 'The Simple Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
