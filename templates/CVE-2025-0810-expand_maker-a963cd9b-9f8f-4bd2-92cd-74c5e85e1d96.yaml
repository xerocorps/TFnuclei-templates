  description: 'The Read More & Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.7. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the addNewButtons() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
