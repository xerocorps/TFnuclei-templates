  description: The Covert VideoPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of VideoJS in various
    versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link.
