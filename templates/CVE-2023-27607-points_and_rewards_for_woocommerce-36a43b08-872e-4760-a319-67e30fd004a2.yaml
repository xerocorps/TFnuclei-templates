  description: 'The Points and Rewards for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This is
    due to a missing nonce check on the wps_wpr_points_update function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged
    request granted they can trick an admin into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
