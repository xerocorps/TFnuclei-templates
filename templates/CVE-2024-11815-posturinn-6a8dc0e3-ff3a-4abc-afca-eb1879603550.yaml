  description: "The P\xF3sturinn\\&#039;s Shipping with WooCommerce plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the printed_marked and nonprinted_marked\
    \ parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
