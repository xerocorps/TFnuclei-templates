  description: 'The Microsoft Clarity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.3. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the edit_clarity_project_id() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to change the project id and add malicious JavaScript
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
