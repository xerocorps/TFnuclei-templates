  description: 'The Lazy Social Comments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via plugin options such as ''box_width'' in versions up to,
    and including, 2.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level access,
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
    installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
