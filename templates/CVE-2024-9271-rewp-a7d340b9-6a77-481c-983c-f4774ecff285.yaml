  description: 'The Re:WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
