  description: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal
    in versions up to, and including, 6.8 via the 'file' parameter which can be manipulated
    during user avatar deletion. This makes it possible with attackers, with minimal
    permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server
    that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the wp-config.php
    file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve remote code
    execution.
