  description: 'The SULly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to reset the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
