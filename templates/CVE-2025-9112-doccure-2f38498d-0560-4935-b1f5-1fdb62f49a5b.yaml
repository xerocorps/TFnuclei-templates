  description: 'The Doccure theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to incorrect file type validation in the ''doccure_temp_file_uploader'' function
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
