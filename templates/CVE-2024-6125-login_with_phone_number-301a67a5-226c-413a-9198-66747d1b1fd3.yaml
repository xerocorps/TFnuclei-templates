  description: 'The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 1.7.34. This is
    due to the plugin generating too weak a reset code, and the code used to reset
    the password has no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to reset the password of arbitrary users by guessing a 6-digit numeric
    reset code.
