  description: "The Payment Gateways Caller for WP e-Commerce plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions before 0.1.1 via the wpscmc_load_merchant\
    \ function. This allows attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the\
    \ server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used\
    \ to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded\
    \ and included."
