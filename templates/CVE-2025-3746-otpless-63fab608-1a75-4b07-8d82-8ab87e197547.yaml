  description: 'The OTP-less one tap Sign in plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.14 to 2.0.59. This is
    due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating
    their details, like email. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to change arbitrary users'' email addresses, including administrators, and leverage
    that to reset the user''s password and gain access to their account. Additionally,
    the plugin returns authentication cookies in the response, which can be used to
    access the account directly.
