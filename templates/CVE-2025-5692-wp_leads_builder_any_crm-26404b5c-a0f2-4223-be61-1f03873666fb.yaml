  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2025-5692
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
    cvss-score: 6.3
  description: 'The Lead Form Data Collection to CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions
    in the ~/includes/LB_admin_ajax.php file in all versions up to, and including,
    3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to perform several actions like updating settings. Initially
    this CVE was assigned specifically to all AJAX actions and the doFieldAjaxAction()
    function, however it was determined that CVE-2025-47690 is assigned to the doFieldAjaxAction()
    function that leads to arbitrary options updates.
