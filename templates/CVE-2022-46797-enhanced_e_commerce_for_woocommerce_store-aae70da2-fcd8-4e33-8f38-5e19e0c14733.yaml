  description: 'The All-in-one Google Analytics, Pixels and Product Feed Manager for
    WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
    versions up to, and including, 5.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
    validation on multiple functions like tvc_call_add_customer_feedback. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make a user with higher privileges
    perform unintended actions such as adding customer feedback, via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
