  description: 'The Support Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    access/modification/deletion of data due to use of hardcoded default secrets in
    the sb_encryption() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass authorization and execute
    arbitrary AJAX actions defined in the sb_ajax_execute() function. An attacker
    can use this vulnerability to exploit CVE-2025-4828 and various other functions
    unauthenticated.
