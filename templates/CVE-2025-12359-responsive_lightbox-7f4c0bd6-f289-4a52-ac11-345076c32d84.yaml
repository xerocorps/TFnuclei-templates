  description: 'The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3 via
    the ''get_image_size_by_url'' function. This is due to insufficient validation
    of user-supplied URLs when determining image dimensions for gallery items. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above,
    to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application
    which can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
