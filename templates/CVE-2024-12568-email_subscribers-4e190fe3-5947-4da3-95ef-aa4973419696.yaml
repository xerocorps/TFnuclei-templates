  description: "The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express \u2013 Affordable, Powerful\
    \ Email Marketing for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Workflow Settings in all versions up to,\
    \ and including, 5.7.44 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
