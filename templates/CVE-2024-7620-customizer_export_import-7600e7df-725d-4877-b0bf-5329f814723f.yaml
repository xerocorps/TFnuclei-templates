  description: 'The Customizer Export/Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''_import''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.7. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible. NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable when used in conjunction
    with a race condition as the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it is created.
