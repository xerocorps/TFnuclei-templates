  description: 'Ensure that an Azure activity log alert is fired whenever "Create/Update
    Storage Account" events are triggered in your Microsoft Azure cloud account. Activity
    log alerts get triggered when a new activity log event that matches the condition
    specified in the alert configuration occurs. For this conformity rule, the matched
    condition is `Whenever the Activity Log has an event with Category="Administrative",
    Signal name="Create/Update Storage Account (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts)"`.

    '
  impact: 'Without proper alert rules configured for monitoring "Create or Update
    Storage Account" events, unauthorized or unwanted changes might go unnoticed,
    leading to potential security risks.
