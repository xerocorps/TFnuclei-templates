  description: "The Page Builder: Pagelayer \u2013 Drag and Drop website builder plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018\
    login_url\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient\
    \ input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\
    \ A valid username/password pair needs to be supplied in order to be successfully\
    \ exploited and any injected scripts will only execute in the context of that\
    \ authenticated user.\n"
