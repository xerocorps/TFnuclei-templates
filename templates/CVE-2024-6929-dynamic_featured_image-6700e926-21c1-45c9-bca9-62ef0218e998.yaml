  description: "The Dynamic Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018dfiFeatured\u2019 parameter in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 3.7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output\
    \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
