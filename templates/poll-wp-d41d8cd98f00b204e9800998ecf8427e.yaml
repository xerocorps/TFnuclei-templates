  description: "The TS Poll \u2013 Best Poll Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018nonce\u2019 parameter\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 1.5.8 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is a\
    \ follow-up patch to 1.5.5, in which the original issue was patched."
