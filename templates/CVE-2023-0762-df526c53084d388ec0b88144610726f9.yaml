  description: 'The Clock In Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the delete action in the designations.php file.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete designations via
    a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
