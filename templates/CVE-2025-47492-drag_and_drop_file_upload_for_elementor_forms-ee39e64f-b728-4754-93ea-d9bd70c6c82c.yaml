  description: 'The Drag and Drop File Upload for Elementor Forms plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
    in the elementor_file_upload_remove() function in all versions up to, and including,
    1.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
