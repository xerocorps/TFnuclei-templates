  description: The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin contains several AJAX actions
    that are not protected by capability or nonce checks in versions up to, and including,
    5.3.5. This allows unauthenticated attackers to perform actions that should be
    restricted to administrators, such as exporting reviews and sending test emails,
    if they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action, such as clicking
    a link.
