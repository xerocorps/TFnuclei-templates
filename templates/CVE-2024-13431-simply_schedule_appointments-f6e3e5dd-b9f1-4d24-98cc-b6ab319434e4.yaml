  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar \u2014 Simply Schedule Appointments\
    \ Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the accent_color and background parameter in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.6.8.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an\
    \ action such as clicking on a link.\n"
