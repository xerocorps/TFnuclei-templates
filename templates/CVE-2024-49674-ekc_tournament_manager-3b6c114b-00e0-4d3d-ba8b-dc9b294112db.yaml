  description: 'The EKC Tournament Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
