    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The Stop Registration Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.23. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2024-56017
    is likely a duplicate of this issue.
