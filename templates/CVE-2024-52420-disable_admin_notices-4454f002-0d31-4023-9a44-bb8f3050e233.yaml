  description: 'The Disable Admin Notices individually plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
