  description: "The Directory Listings WordPress plugin \u2013 uListing plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.2.0 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No\
    \ known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability\
    \ has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed\
    \ on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed\
    \ on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete\
    \ arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP\
    \ chain present.\n"
