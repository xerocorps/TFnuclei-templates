    cvss-score: 9.8
  description: 'The Golo - City Travel Guide WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is
    vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s
    identity prior to setting an authorization cookie. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, provided
    they know the user''s email address. CVE-2025-54725 is likely a duplicate of this
    issue.
