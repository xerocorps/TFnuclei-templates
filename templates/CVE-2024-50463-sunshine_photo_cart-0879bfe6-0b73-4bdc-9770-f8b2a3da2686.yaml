  description: 'The Sunshine Photo Cart: Free Client Photo Galleries for Photographers
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and
    including, 3.2.9. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially
    malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
