  description: 'The Workreap WordPress theme before 2.2.2 AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader
    and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that
    the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading
    arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither
    sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable
    code such as php scripts.
