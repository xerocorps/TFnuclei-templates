  description: 'The Sequential Order Numbers for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    3.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
