  description: The Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation in the plugin's Import tab. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute
    in a victim's browser via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
