  description: "The Forminator \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.13.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation\
    \ on the listen_for_saving_export_schedule() function. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to export form submissions via a forged request\
    \ granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as\
    \ clicking on a link.\n"
