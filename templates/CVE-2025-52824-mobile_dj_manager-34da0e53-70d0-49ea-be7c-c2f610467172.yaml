  description: 'The MDJM Event Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
    escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This
    is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior to updating
    their details like password through the mdjm_validate_client_profile AJAX action.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
    and above, to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators, and
    leverage that to gain access to their account.
