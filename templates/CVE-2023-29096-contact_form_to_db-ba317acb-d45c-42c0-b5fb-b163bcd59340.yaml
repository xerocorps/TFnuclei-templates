  description: 'The Contact Form to DB by BestWebSoft plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to SQL Injection via the cntctfrmtdb_department parameter in versions up to, and
    including, 1.7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and
    lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers , with contributor-level access and above, to append
    additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract
    sensitive information from the database.
