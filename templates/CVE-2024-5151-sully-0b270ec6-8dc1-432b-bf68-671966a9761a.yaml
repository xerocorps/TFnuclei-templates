    cvss-score: 4.4
  description: 'The SULly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.3 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
