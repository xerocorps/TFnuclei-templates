    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Attachment File Icons (AF Icons) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and
    including, 1.3. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ''afi_overview''
    function and missing file type validation in the ''upload_icons'' function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
