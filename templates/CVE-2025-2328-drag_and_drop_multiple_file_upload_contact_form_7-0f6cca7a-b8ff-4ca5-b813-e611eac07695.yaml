    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path
    validation in the ''dnd_remove_uploaded_files'' function in all versions up to,
    and including, 1.3.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    add arbitrary file paths (such as ../../../../wp-config.php) to uploaded files
    on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when an Administrator
    deletes the message. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the Flamingo plugin
    to be installed and activated.
