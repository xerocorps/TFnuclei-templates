  description: 'The Academist Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to the academist_membership_check_facebook_user()
    function not properly verifying a user''s identity prior to authenticating them.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including
    site administrators.
