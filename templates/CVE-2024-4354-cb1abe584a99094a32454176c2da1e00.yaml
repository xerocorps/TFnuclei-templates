  description: "The TablePress \u2013 Tables in WordPress made easy plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.3 via the get_files_to_import() function. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary\
    \ locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and\
    \ modify information from internal services. Due to the complex nature of protecting\
    \ against DNS rebind attacks in WordPress software, we settled on the developer\
    \ simply restricting the usage of the URL import functionality to just administrators.\
    \ While this is not optimal, we feel this poses a minimal risk to most site owners\
    \ and ideally WordPress core would correct this issue in wp_safe_remote_get()\
    \ and other functions.\n"
