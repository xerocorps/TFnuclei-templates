  description: "The OceanWP  theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This allows subscriber-level attackers\
    \ to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution\
    \ of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,\
    \ obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other\
    \ \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
