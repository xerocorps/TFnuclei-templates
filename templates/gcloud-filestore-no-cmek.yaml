  description: 'Ensure that data stored on your Google Cloud Filestore instances is
    encrypted at rest with Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) instead of Google-managed
    encryption keys. CMEKs provide greater control over the encryption and decryption
    process, enabling you to meet stringent compliance requirements.

    '
  impact: 'Without Customer-Managed Encryption Keys, you have less control over data
    encryption and key management, potentially impacting compliance requirements and
    security controls.

  remediation: 'Re-create your Filestore instances with Customer-Managed Encryption
    Keys using Cloud KMS. Configure a key ring and CMK in Cloud KMS, then specify
    the key when creating the instance using the ''--kms-key'' flag or through the
