  description: 'The WP Dropzone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated
    arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via the `ajax_upload_handle`
    function. This is due to the chunked upload functionality writing files directly
    to the uploads directory before any file type validation occurs. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above,
    to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote
    code execution possible.
