  description: 'The Work The Flow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the accept_file_types function
    in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
