  description: 'The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirect
    in version 2.8.4. This is due to an insecure OAuth implementation, as the ''redirect_uri''
    parameter is missing validation during the authorization flow. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to intercept the authorization code and obtain an
    access token by redirecting the user to an attacker-controlled URI. Note: OAuth
    is disabled, the ''Meow_MWAI_Labs_OAuth'' class is not loaded in the plugin in
    the patched version 2.8.5.
