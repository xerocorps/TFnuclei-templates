  description: "The Formidable Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, Payment, Calculator\
    \ Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the name field label and description field label parameter in\
    \ all versions up to 6.7 (inclusive) due to insufficient input sanitization and\
    \ output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level\
    \ access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. By default, this only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. However, in the formidable\
    \ settings admins can extend form creation, deletion and other management permissions\
    \ to other user types, which makes it possible for this vulnerability to be exploited\
    \ by lower level user types as long as they have been granted the proper permissions.\n"
