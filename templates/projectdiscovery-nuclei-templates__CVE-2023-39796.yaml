  description: 'There is an sql injection vulnerability in "miniform module" which
    is a default module installed in the WBCE cms. It is an unauthenticated sqli so
    anyone could access it and takeover the whole database. In file "/modules/miniform/ajax_delete_message.php"
    there is no authentication check. On line 40 in this file, there is a DELETE query
    that is vulnerable, an attacker could jump from the query using the tick sign
    - `.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can execute time-based SQL injection through
    the DB_RECORD_TABLE parameter in the miniform module to extract the complete CMS
    database and takeover the WBCE installation.
