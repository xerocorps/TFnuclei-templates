  description: 'The Extra Product Options Builder for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    1.2.104. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the DontShowAgain()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
