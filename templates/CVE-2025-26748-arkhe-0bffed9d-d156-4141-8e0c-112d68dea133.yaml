  description: 'The Arkhe theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.11.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to include and execute code in files via a forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
