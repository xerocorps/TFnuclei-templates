  description: "The WP Job Portal \u2013 A Complete Recruitment System for Company\
    \ or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion,\
    \ Arbitrary Settings Update, and User Creation in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.1.6 via several functions called by the 'checkFormRequest' function. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary\
    \ files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files.\
    \ This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve\
    \ code execution in cases where images and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can\
    \ be uploaded and included. Attackers can also update arbitrary settings and create\
    \ user accounts even when registration is disabled, leading to user creation with\
    \ a default role of Administrator.\n"
