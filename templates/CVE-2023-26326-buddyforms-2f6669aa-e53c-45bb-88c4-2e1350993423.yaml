  description: 'The BuddyForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization
    of untrusted input via the ''url'' parameter in versions up to, and including
    2.7.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions,
    such as a subscriber, to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize
    the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety
    of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that
    the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload, however,
    this can easily be achieved by uploading a fake profile photo prior to launching
    an attack.
