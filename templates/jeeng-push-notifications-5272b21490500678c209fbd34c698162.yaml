  description: 'The Jeeng Push Notifications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This is due
    to missing nonce validation on the jeeng_page() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
