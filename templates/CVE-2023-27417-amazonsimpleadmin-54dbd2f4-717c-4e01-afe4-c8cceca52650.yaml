  description: 'The Affiliate Super Assistent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.1. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions such as the ''_displayPreDispatcher'',
    ''_displayDispatcher'', & ''_displayTestPage'' functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform many actions like updating plugin settings
    via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
