  description: 'The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check on the fnsf_delete_posts
    function in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts,
    including administrator posts, and posts not related to the Funnelforms Free plugin.  CVE-2023-5990
    appears to be a duplicate of this issue.
