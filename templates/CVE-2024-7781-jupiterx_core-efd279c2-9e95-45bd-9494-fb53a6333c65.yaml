  description: 'The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.5. This is due to improper authentication
    via the Social Login widget. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to log in as the first user to have logged in with a social media account, including
    administrator accounts. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability even if the Social
    Login element has been disabled, as long as it was previously enabled and used.
    The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.7.5, and fully patched in
    version 4.7.8.
