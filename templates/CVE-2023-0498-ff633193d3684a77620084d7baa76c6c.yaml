  description: 'The WP Education plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''plugin_activation'' function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already
    installed (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
