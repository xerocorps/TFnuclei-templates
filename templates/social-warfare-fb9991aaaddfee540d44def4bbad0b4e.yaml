  description: 'Several plugins for WordPress hosted on WordPress.org have been compromised
    and injected with malicious PHP scripts. A malicious threat actor compromised
    the source code of various plugins and injected code that exfiltrates database
    credentials and is used to create new, malicious, administrator users and send
    that data back to a server. Currently, not all plugins have been patched and we
    strongly recommend uninstalling the plugins for the time being and running a complete
    malware scan.
