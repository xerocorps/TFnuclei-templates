  description: 'The Poll, Survey & Quiz Maker Plugin by Opinion Stage plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
    19.12.0. This is due to missing or insufficient nonce validation on the disconnect_account_action
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the
    site from the Opinion Stage platform integration via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
