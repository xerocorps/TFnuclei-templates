  description: 'The Paid Memberships Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcode(s) in versions up to, and including,
    2.9.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
    attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor
    level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
    execute whenever a user accesses an injected page
