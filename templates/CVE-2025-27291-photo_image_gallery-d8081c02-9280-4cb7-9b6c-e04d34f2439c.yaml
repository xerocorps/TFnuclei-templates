  description: "The WordPress Photo Gallery \u2013 Image Gallery plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in\
    \ pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an\
    \ action such as clicking on a link.\n"
