  description: Grafana instances up to 7.5.11 and 8.1.5 allow remote unauthenticated
    users to view the snapshot associated with the lowest database key by accessing
    the literal paths /api/snapshot/:key or /dashboard/snapshot/:key. If the snapshot
    is in public mode, unauthenticated users can delete snapshots by accessing the
    endpoint /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Authenticated users can also delete
    snapshots by accessing the endpoints /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, or sending
    a delete request to /api/snapshot/:key, regardless of whether or not the snapshot
    is set to public mode (disabled by default).

  remediation: 'This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11. If you
    cannot upgrade you can block access to the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key,
    /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and /api/snapshots/:key.
    They have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects.'
