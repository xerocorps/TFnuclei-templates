  description: 'An issue was discovered in the PageLayer plugin before 1.1.2 for WordPress.
    Nearly all of the AJAX action endpoints lacked permission checks, allowing these
    actions to be executed by anyone authenticated on the site. This happened because
    nonces were used as a means of authorization, but a nonce was present in a publicly
    viewable page. The greatest impact was the pagelayer_save_content function that
    allowed pages to be modified and allowed XSS to occur.
