  description: 'The Flow-Flow Social Feed Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the
    flow_flow_social_auth AJAX action in versions 3.0.0 to 4.7.5. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify
    plugin settings and store arbitrary JavaScript that executes whenever the plugin
    settings page is viewed.
