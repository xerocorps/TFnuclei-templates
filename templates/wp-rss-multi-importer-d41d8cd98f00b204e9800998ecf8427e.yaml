  description: The WP RSS Multi Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to 3.14. This is due to missing nonce validation
    on several GET request functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to perform restricted actions, such as arbitrary post deletion, via forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
