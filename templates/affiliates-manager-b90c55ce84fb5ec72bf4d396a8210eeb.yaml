  description: 'The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.13. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the process_individual_action function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliates and commissions,
    via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
