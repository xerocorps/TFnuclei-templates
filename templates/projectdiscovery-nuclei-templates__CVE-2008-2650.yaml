  description: 'CMSimple 3.1 is susceptible to local file inclusion via cmsimple/cms.php
    when register_globals is enabled which allows remote attackers to include and
    execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the sl parameter to index.php.
    NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file execution by including adm.php and
    then invoking the upload action. NOTE: on 20080601, the vendor patched 3.1 without
    changing the version number.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized
    access to sensitive files, remote code execution, and potential compromise of
    the entire system.
