  description: 'The Map My Locations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''map_my_locations'' shortcode in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
