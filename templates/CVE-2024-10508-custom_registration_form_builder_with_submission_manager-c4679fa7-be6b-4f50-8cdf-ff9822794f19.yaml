  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 User Registration Plugin with Custom\
    \ Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation\
    \ via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2.6. This is\
    \ due to the plugin not properly validating the password reset token prior to\
    \ updating a user's password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to reset the password of arbitrary users, including administrators, and gain\
    \ access to these accounts.\n"
