  description: 'The Website Contact Form With File Upload plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the

    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected
    sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
