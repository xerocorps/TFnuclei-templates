  description: 'The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including,
    2.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping affecting the
    rl_upload_image AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses the 3gp2 file.
