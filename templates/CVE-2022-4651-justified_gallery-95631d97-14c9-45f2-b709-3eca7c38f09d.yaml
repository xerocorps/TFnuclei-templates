  description: 'The Justified Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 1.7.0 due to insufficient
    sanitization and escaping on the attribute values passed through the plugins shortcode.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level and
    above privileges to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
