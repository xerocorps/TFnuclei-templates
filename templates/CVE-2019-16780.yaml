  description: WordPress users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject
    JavaScript code in the block editor using a specific payload, which is executed
    within the dashboard. This can lead to XSS if an admin opens the post in the editor.
    Execution of this attack does require an authenticated user. This has been patched
    in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to
    5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are enabled by default for minor releases
    and we strongly recommend that you keep them enabled.
