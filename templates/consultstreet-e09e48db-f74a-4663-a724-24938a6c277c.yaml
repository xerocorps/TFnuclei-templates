  description: 'Multiple themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''id'' parameter found in the ''[different-value]_customizer_notify_dismiss_action''
    and ''[different-value]_customizer_notify_dismiss_recommended_plugins'' AJAX actions
    in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. The following are additional known variants
    of the AJAX actions: ''[different-value]_customizer_notify_dismiss_recommended_action_callback''
    & ''[different-value]_customizer_notify_dismiss_recommended_plugins_callback''
