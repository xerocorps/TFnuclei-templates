  description: 'The Database Backup and check Tables Automated With Scheduler 2024
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient
    file path validation in the ''database_backup_ajax_delete'' function in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.35. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,
    which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted
    (such as wp-config.php). The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.36.
