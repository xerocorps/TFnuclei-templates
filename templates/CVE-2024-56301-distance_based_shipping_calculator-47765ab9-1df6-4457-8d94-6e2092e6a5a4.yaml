  description: 'The Distance Based Shipping Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.21
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
