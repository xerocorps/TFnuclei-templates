  description: 'The Conditional Shipping for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the toggle_ruleset function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function, via forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
