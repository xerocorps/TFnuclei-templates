  description: 'The WPFunnels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.5.26 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
