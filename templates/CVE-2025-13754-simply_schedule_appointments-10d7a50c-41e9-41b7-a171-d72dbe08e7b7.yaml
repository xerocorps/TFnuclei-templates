  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar \u2014 Simply Schedule Appointments\
    \ Booking Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.9.16. This is due to the plugin exposing\
    \ its admin embed endpoint at `/wp-json/ssa/v1/embed-inner-admin` without authentication,\
    \ which leaks plugin settings including staff names, business names, and configuration\
    \ data that are not publicly displayed on the booking form. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to extract private business configuration. In\
    \ premium versions with integrations configured, this might also expose other\
    \ sensitive data including API keys for external services.\n"
