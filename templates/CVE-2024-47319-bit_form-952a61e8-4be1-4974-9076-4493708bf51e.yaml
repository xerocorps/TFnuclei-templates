  description: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact
    Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in
    all versions up to, and including, 2.13.10. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files
    on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
