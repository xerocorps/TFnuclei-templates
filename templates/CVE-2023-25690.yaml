  description: 'Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0
    through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected
    when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch
    in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target
    (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable
    substitution. Note: Not sure why, but need to declare "-var Path=/the/path" in
    command syntax or it adds the url path twice.

    '
  impact: 'Allows attackers to target and access internal applications that are meant
    to be hidden by the reverse proxy, potentially leading to unauthorized access,
    data leakage, or further exploitation.
