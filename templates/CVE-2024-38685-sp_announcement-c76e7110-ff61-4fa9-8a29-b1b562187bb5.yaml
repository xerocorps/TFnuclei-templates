  description: 'The WP Announcement plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, <=2.0.8 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
