  description: 'The WPQA - Builder forms Addon For WordPress plugin is vulnerable
    to insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 5.9.2 along
    with the Himer (<= 1.9.3) and Discy (<= 5.5.3) WordPress themes. This is due to
    insufficient validation of user follows on the wpqa_following_you_ajax action.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities
    and above to inflate follower counts of others by sending repeat follow requests.
