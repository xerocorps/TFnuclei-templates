  description: 'The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''Additional tax classes'' field when the tax functionality
    of WooCommerce is enabled in versions up to, and including, 5.1.3 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects
    multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
