  description: 'The Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 via deserialization of untrusted input
    from wd_gallery_$id parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP
    chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an
    additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
    attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
