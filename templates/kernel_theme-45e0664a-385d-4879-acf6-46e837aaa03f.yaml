  description: 'The kernel-theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via the uploadify.php file in all
    versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
