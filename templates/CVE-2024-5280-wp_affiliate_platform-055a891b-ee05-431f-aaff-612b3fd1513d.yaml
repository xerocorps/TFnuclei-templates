  description: 'The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.0. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''info_update'' functionality. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious
    web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
