  description: 'The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.93. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the lwp_forgot_password() and lwp_update_password_action()
    functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update other
    users passwords via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
