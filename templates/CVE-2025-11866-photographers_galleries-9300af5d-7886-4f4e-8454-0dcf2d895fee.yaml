  description: 'The Photographers galleries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple shortcode attributes (`w`, `h`, `raw_css`,
    `look`, etc.) in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.8. This is due to the
    plugin not properly sanitizing user input or escaping output when inserting these
    values into HTML attributes and inline styles. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
