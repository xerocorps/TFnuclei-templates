  description: 'The Ldap WP Login / Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to authorization bypass and Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
    up to, and including 3.0.1, due to missing nonce and capability checks on several
    of it''s functions called via init hooks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to update the plugin''s setting and potentially connect their own LDAP
    server to make authentication bypass possible.
