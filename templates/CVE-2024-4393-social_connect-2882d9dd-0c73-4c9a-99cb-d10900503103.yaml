  description: 'The Social Connect plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to insufficient verification
    on the OpenID server being supplied during the social login through the plugin.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing
    user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.
