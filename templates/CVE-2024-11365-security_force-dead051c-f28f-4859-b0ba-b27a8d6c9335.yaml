  description: "The Crypto and DeFi Widgets \u2013 Web3 Cryptocurrency Shortcodes\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to\
    \ the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 1.1.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
