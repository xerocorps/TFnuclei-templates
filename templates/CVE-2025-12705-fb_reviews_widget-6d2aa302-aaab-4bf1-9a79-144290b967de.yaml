  description: 'The Social Reviews & Recommendations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in the ''trim_text'' function
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.5.
