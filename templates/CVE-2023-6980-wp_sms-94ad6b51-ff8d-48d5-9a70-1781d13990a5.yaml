  description: "The WP SMS \u2013 Messaging & SMS Notification for WordPress, WooCommerce,\
    \ GravityForms, etc plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect\
    \ nonce validation on the 'delete' action of the wp-sms-subscribers page. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete subscribers via a\
    \ forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an\
    \ action such as clicking on a link.\n"
