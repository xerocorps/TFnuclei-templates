  description: 'The WP QuickLaTeX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the ''Advanced'' tab text field in all versions up to, and including,
    3.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
