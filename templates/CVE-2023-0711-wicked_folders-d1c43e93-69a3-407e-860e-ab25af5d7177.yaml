  description: 'The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on the ajax_save_state function in versions
    up to, and including, 2.18.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke this function and perform
    actions intended for administrators such as modifying the view state of the folder
    structure maintained by the plugin.
