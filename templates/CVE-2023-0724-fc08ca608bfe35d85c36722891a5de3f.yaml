  description: 'The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_add_folder function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link leading them to perform actions intended for administrators such as
    changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin.
