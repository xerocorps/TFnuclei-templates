  description: The Contact Form and Calls To Action by vcita plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    2.6.4. This is due to missing nonce validation in the vcita-callback.php file.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings
    and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
