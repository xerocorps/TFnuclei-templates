  description: 'The WP Responsive Meet The Team plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''wprm_team'' shortcode in all versions
    up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
