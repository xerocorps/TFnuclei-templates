  description: 'The Chained Quiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.2.4. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the manage() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete submitted quiz responses via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
