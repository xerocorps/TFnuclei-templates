  description: 'The Preschool and Kindergarten theme for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due
    to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the preschool_and_kindergarten_update_admin_notice()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
