  description: 'The Fluent Forms plugin for WordPress by Fluent Forms plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including,
    5.1.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
    whenever a user accesses an injected page. The exploitation level depends on who
    is granted the right to create forms by an administrator. This level can be as
    low as contributor, but by default is admin.
