  description: 'The Wishful Blog theme, versions up to and including 2.0.1, and Raise
    Mag theme, versions up to and including 1.0.7, for WordPress are vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
