  description: 'The Careerfy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
    & Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.0. This is due
    to missing nonce validation and capability checks on several functions. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber,
    to trigger several AJAX actions that can perform operations like importing jobs
    and modifyig custom settings. This can also be exploited via CSRF.
