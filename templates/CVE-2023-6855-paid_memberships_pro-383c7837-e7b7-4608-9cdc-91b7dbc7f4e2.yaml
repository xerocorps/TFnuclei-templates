  description: "The Paid Memberships Pro \u2013 Content Restriction, User Registration,\
    \ & Paid Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification\
    \ of membership levels created by the plugin due to an incorrectly implemented\
    \ capability check in the pmpro_rest_api_get_permissions_check function in all\
    \ versions up to 2.12.5 (inclusive). This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to change membership levels including prices.\n"
