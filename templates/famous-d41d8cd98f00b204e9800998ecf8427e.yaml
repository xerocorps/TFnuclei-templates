  description: The Famous theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
    due to missing file type validation via the /megaframe/megapanel/inc/upload.php
    file in all versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code
    execution possible.
