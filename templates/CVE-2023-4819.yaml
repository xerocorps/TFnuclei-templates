  description: "The Shared Files \u2013 Advanced File Sharing & Download Manager with\
    \ Frontend Uploads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via uploaded file content in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5 due to\
    \ the plugin not returning the correct 'Content-Type' header when viewing uploaded\
    \ files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in uploaded files that will execute whenever a user accesses the\
    \ injected upload.\n"
