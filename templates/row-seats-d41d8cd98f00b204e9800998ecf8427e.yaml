  description: The Row Seats Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.66 via deserialization of untrusted
    input from several parameters such as 'mycartitems'. This allows attackers to
    inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP
    chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
    it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data,
    or execute code.
