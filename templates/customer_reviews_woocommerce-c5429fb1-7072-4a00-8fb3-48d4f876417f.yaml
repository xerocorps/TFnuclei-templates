  description: 'The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized access of functionality due to a missing capability check on several
    AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 5.36.0. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers with subscriber level access to cancel exports and
    obtain progress reports on exports.
