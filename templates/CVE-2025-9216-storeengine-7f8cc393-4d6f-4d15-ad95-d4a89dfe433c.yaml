  description: "The StoreEngine \u2013 Powerful WordPress eCommerce Plugin for Payments,\
    \ Memberships, Affiliates, Sales & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the import() function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files\
    \ on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.\n"
