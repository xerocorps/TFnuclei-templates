  description: 'The Spin Wheel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to client-side prize
    manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This is due to the plugin
    trusting client-supplied prize selection data without server-side validation or
    randomization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate
    which prize they win by modifying the ''prize_index'' parameter sent to the server,
    allowing them to always select the most valuable prizes.
