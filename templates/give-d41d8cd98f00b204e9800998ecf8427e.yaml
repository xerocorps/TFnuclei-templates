  description: The GiveWP plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
    up to, and including, 2.25.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on the 'render_dropdown' AJAX function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to execute JavaScript in the browser of an administrator via forged
    request granted a CSV file containing JavaScript in the column names has been
    uploaded and they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
    as clicking on a link. Note that it is only possible to upload CSV files containing
    JavaScript tags in cases where ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS is enabled.
