  description: 'The Aviation Weather from NOAA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions
    up to, and including, 0.7.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
    with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,
    which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted
    (such as wp-config.php).
