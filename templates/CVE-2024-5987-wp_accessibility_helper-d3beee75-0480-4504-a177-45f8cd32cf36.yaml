  description: 'The WP Accessibility Helper (WAH) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the
    ''save_contrast_variations'' and ''save_empty_contrast_variations'' functions
    in all versions up to, and including, 0.6.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to edit or delete contrast
    settings.  Please note these issues were patched in 0.6.2.8, though it broke functionality
    and the vendor has not responded to our follow-ups.
