  description: 'The WordPress User Registration Forms by Formidable Forms plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary user password reset and account takeover
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.11. This is due to the plugin allowing
    users with access to the editor to utilize the frm-set-password-link shortcode
    and supply any user ID. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to reset the password of any user account
    and achieve account takeover
