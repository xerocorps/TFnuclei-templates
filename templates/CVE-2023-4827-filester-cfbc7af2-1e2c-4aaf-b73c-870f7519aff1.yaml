  description: 'The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the fsConnector function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to rename an arbitrary file and ultimately execute
    arbitrary code via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
