  description: "The WP Courses LMS \u2013 Online Courses Builder, eLearning Courses,\
    \ Courses Solution, Education Courses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site\
    \ Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to\
    \ missing nonce validation on several functions hooked via AJAX in the ~/ajax/ajax-lesson-order.php\
    \ file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to perform several\
    \ actions such as adding, deleting and renaming lesson modules via a forged request\
    \ granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as\
    \ clicking on a link.\n"
