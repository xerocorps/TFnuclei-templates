  description: 'The Rabbit Hole plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the plugin''s reset functionality. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin''s settings via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the reset
    operation is performed via a GET request, making exploitation trivial via image
    tags or hyperlinks.
