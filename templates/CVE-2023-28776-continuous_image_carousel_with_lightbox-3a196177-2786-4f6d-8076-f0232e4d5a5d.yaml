    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    cvss-score: 6.1
  description: 'The Continuous Image Carousel With Lightbox for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the search_term, order_by and order_pos
    parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.15 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note
    there is not enough information to distinguish this from CVE-2023-28792.
