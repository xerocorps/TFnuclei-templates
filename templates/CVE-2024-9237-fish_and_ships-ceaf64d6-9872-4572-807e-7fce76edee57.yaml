  description: "The Fish and Ships \u2013 Most flexible shipping table rate. A WooCommerce\
    \ shipping rate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 1.5.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
