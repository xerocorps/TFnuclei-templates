  description: 'Ensure that "Define Allowed External IPs for VM Instances" constraint
    policy is enforced at the GCP organization level in order to enable you to define
    the set of virtual machine (VM) instances that are allowed to use external IP
    addresses. This constraint helps you to minimize your instance''s exposure to
    the Internet.

    '
  impact: 'By default, all Google Cloud virtual machine instances are allowed to use
    external IP addresses. Without proper constraints, this increases the attack surface
    as instances may be unnecessarily exposed to the internet.

  remediation: 'Configure the "Define Allowed External IPs for VM Instances" policy
    at the organization level to explicitly specify which VM instances are allowed
    to have external IP addresses. Use the format: projects/<project-id>/zones/<instance-zone>/instances/<instance-name>.
