  description: 'The Restrict File Access plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the ''restrict-file-access'' page. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to delete arbitrary files on the
    server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is
    deleted (such as wp-config.php), via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
