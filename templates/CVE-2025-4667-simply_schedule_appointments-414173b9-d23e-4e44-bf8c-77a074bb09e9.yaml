  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar \u2014 Simply Schedule Appointments\
    \ Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting\
    \ via the plugin's ssa_admin_upcoming_appointments, ssa_admin_upcoming_appointments,\
    \ and ssa_past_appointments shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.8.30\
    \ due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied\
    \ attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
