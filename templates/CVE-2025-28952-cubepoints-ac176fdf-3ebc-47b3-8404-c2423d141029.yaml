    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
