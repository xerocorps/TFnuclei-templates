    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The RESTful Content Syndication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ingest_image()
    function in versions 1.1.0 to 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible. This requires
    the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings,
    so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and
    more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin''s
    settings.
