  description: 'The Awesome Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to incorrect authorization in the room-single.php shortcode
    handler in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin
    relying solely on nonce verification without capability checks. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary booking records by
    obtaining a nonce from the public booking form.
