  description: 'The Booking calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation when creating, editing, duplicating and deleting
    bookings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate bookings
    using these actions via forged request granted they can trick an administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
