  description: 'The Restrict User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update() function. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
