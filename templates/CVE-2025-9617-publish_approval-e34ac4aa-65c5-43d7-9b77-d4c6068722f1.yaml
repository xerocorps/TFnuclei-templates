  description: 'The Publish approval plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the publish_save_option function. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
