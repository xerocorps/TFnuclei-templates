  description: 'The WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the vc_custom_heading shortcode in all versions up to,
    and including, 8.6.1. This is due to insufficient restriction of allowed HTML
    tags and improper sanitization of user-supplied attributes in the font_container
    parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level
    access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts in posts that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page via the vc_custom_heading shortcode with malicious
    tag and text attributes granted they have access to use WPBakery shortcodes.
