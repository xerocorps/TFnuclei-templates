  description: "The Interactive Medical Drawing of Human Body plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018anatomy_basic\u2019\
    \ parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.4  due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to\
    \ inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
