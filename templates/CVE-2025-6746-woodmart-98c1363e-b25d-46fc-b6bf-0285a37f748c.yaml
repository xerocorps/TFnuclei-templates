  description: 'The WoodMart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
    in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.3 via the ''layout'' attribute. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and
    above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the
    execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,
    obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php files can
    be uploaded and included.
