  description: "The AFI \u2013 The Easiest Integration Plugin plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg\
    \ & remove_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.92.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully\
    \ trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
