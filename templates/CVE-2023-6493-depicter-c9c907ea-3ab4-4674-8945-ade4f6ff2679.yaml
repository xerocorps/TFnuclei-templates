  description: "The Depicter Slider \u2013 Responsive Image Slider, Video Slider &\
    \ Post Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect\
    \ nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they\
    \ can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on\
    \ a link. CVE-2023-51491 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.\n"
