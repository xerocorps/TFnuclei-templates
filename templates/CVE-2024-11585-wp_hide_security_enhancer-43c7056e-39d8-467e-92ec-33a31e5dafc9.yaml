  description: 'The WP Hide & Security Enhancer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file contents deletion due to a missing authorization and insufficient
    file path validation in the file-process.php in all versions up to, and including,
    2.5.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the contents
    of arbitrary files on the server, which can break the site or lead to data loss.
