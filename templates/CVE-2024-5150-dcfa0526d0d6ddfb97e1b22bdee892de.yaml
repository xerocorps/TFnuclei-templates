  description: 'The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.7.26. This is due to
    the ''activation_code'' default value is empty, and the not empty check is missing
    in the ''lwp_ajax_register'' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
    if they have access to the user email. The vulnerability is patched in version
    1.7.26, but there is an issue in the patch that causes the entire function to
    not work, and this issue is fixed in version 1.7.27.
