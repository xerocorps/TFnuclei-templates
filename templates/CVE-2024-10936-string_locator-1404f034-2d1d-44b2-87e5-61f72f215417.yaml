  description: 'The String locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
    Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6 via deserialization of untrusted
    input in the ''recursive_unserialize_replace'' function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
    in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin
    or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete
    arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must
    perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.
