  description: 'The 17TRACK for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.10 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
