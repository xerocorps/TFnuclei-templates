  description: The User Registration, User Profile, Login & Membership &#8211; ProfilePress
    (Formerly WP User Avatar) WordPress plugin before 3.1.11's widget for tabbed login/register
    was not properly escaped and could be used in an XSS attack which could lead to
    wp-admin access. Further, the plugin in several places assigned $_POST as $_GET
    which meant that in some cases this could be replicated with just $_GET parameters
    and no need for $_POST values.
