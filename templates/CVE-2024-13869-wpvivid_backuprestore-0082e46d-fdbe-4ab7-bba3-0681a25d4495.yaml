  description: "The Migration, Backup, Staging \u2013 WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type\
    \ validation in the 'upload_files' function in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 0.9.112. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level\
    \ access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which\
    \ may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible\
    \ on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess\
    \ within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.\n"
