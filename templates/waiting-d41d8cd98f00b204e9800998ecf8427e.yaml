  description: 'The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on its AJAX calls in
    versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to create and delete countdowns
    as well as manipulate other plugin settings.'
