  description: 'The NewsBlogger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.2.5.4. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the newsblogger_install_and_activate_plugin()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files and achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
