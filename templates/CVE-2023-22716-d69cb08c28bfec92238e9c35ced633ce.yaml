  description: 'The OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via options such as ''oopspam_wpregister_spam_message'',
    ''oopspam_woo_spam_message'', and ''oopspam_give_spam_message'' (as well as numerous
    others) in versions up to, and including, 1.1.35 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page.
