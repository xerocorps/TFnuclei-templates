  description: The YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized gift card creation due to a missing capability check on one of
    its functions in versions up to, and including, 3.23.1. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to create gift cards. Sanitization of user input
    is also insufficient, which allows users to inject malicious scripts.
