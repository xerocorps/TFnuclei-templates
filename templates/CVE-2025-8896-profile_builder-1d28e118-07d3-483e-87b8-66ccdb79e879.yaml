  description: "The User Profile Builder \u2013 Beautiful User Registration Forms,\
    \ User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the 'gdpr_communication_preferences[]' parameter in\
    \ all versions up to, and including, 3.14.3 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable\
    \ when the GDPR Communication Preferences module is enabled and at least one GDPR\
    \ Communication Preferences field has been added to the edit profile form.\n"
