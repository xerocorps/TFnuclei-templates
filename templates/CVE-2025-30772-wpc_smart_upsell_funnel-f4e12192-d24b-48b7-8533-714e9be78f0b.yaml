    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The WPC Smart Upsell Funnel for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation
    due to a missing capability check on the ajax_import_export_save() function in
    all versions up to, and including, 3.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options
    on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration
    to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative
    user access to a vulnerable site.
