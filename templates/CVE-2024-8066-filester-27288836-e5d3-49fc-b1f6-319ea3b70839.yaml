  description: "The File Manager Pro \u2013 Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to arbitrary file uploads due to missing validation in the 'fsConnector' function\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This makes it possible for authenticated\
    \ attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by\
    \ an Administrator, to upload a new .htaccess file allowing them to subsequently\
    \ upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code\
    \ execution possible.\n"
