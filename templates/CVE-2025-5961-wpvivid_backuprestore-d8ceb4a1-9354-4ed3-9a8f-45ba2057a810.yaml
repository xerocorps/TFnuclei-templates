  description: "The Migration, Backup, Staging \u2013 WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type\
    \ validation in the 'wpvivid_upload_import_files' function in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 0.9.116. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the\
    \ affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE:\
    \ Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX\
    \ web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents\
    \ access on Apache servers.\n"
