  description: 'The Qi Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access
    due to a missing capability check on the `resize_image_callback()` function in
    all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This is due to the plugin not properly
    verifying that a user has permission to resize a specific attachment. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,
    to resize arbitrary media library images belonging to other users, which can result
    in unintended file writes, disk consumption, and server resource abuse through
    processing of large images.
