  description: 'It was possible to exploit an Unauthenticated Time-Based Blind SQL
    Injection vulnerability in the Spam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk
    WordPress Plugin before 5.153.4. The update_log function in lib/Cleantalk/ApbctWP/Firewall/SFW.php
    included a vulnerable query that could be injected via the User-Agent Header by
    manipulating the cookies set by the Spam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk
    WordPress plugin before 5.153.4, sending an initial request to obtain a ct_sfw_pass_key
    cookie and then manually setting a separate ct_sfw_passed cookie and disallowing
    it from being reset.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated attackers can extract database contents via time-based
    blind SQL injection through User-Agent header manipulation, potentially exposing
    all WordPress user data.
