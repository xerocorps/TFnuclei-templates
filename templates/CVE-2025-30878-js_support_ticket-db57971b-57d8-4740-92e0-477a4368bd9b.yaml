  description: "The JS Help Desk \u2013 The Ultimate Help Desk & Support Plugin plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file\
    \ path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This\
    \ makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on\
    \ the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file\
    \ is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
