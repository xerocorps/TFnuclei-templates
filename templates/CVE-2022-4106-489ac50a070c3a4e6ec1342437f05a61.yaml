  description: 'The Wholesale Market for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary file download due to missing capability checks and user input validation
    during the system path generation process in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary files
    on the affected sites server, including database configuration files. While version
    1.0.7 adds capability checks, the issue remains exploitable by high-level users.
