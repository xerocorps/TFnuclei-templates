  description: 'The Ninja Forms - File Uploads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an uploaded file (e.g. RTX file) in all versions
    up to, and including, 3.3.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
