  description: 'Pupy is a cross-platform, multi function RAT and post-exploitation
    tool mainly written in python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline
    and leaves a very low footprint. Pupy can communicate using multiple transports,
    migrate into processes using reflective injection, and load remote python code,
    python packages and python C-extensions from memory.
