  description: 'The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly
    verifying a user''s identity prior to authenticating them through the sb_login_user_with_otp_fun()
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary
    users, including administrators.
