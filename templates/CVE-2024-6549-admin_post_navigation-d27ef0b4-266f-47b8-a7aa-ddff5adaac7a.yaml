  description: 'The Admin Post Navigation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full
    Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to the
    plugin utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the
    web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed
    is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for
    damage to an affected website.
