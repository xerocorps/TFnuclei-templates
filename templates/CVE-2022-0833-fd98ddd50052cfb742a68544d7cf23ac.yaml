  description: 'The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated
    Backup Disclosure in versions up to, and including, 3.4.134. Attackers can repeatedly
    request the "refresh-backup" action and simultaneously request a publicly accessible
    temporary file generated by the plugin in order to disclose the final backup filename.  Once
    obtaining that backup name, the plugin lacks sufficient protections to prevent
    accessing those files externally.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to download the backup of the plugin''s data once they conduct this
    attack, which requires a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
