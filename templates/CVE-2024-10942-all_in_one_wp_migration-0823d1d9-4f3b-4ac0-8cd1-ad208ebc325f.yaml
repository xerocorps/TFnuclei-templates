    cvss-score: 7.5
  description: 'The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.89 via deserialization
    of untrusted input in the ''replace_serialized_values'' function. This makes it
    possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
    is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional
    plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
    delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator
    must export and restore a backup in order to trigger the exploit.
