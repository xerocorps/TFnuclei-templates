  description: 'The WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, and including 8.0.7.
    This is due to insufficient file type validation on the wpsp_upload_attachment
    AJAX action which makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
    files that could be used to obtain remote code execution.
