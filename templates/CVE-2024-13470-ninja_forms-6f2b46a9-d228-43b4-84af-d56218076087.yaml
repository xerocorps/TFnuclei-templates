  description: "The Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's\
    \ shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.24 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it\
    \ possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ an injected page.\n"
