  description: The MemberPress Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation and missing capabilities checks
    on one of its AJAX endpoints in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and
    above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
