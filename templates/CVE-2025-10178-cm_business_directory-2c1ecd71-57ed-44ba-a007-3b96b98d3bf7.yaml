  description: 'The CM Business Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s ''cmbd_featured_image'' shortcode in all
    versions up to, and including, 1.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
