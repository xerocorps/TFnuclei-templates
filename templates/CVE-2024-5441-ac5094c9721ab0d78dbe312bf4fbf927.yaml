  description: 'The Modern Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_featured_image function
    in all versions up to, and including, 7.11.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the
    affected site''s server which may make remote code execution possible. The plugin
    allows administrators (via its settings) to extend the ability to submit events
    to unauthenticated users, which would allow unauthenticated attackers to exploit
    this vulnerability.
