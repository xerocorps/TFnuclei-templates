  description: 'The WP Count Down Timer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters of the ''wp_countdown_timer'' shortcode
    in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
