  description: 'The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2. This is due to the plugin allowing
    users who are registering new accounts to set their own role. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account
    with the Administrator, Editor, or Shop Manager role.
