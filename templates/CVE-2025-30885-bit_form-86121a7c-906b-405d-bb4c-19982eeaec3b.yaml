  description: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact
    Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 2.18.0. This
    is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if
    they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
