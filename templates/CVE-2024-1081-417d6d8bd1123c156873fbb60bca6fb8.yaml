  description: "The 3D FlipBook \u2013 PDF Flipbook WordPress plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's bookmark feature\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.3 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with\
    \ contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
    \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
