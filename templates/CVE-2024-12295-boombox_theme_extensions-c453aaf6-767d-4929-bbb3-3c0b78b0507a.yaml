  description: 'The BoomBox Theme Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
    1.8.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user''s identity prior
    to updating their password through the ''boombox_ajax_reset_password'' function.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level privileges
    and above, to change arbitrary user''s passwords, including administrators, and
    leverage that to gain access to their account.
