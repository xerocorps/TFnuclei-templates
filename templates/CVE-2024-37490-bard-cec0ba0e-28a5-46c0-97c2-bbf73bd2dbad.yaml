  description: 'The Bard theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
    in versions up to, and including, 2.210. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
    validation on the bard_activation_notice() function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
