  description: "The RabbitLoader \u2013 Website Speed Optimization for improving Core\
    \ Web Vital metrics with Cache, Image Optimization, and more plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg\
    \ without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 2.21.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary\
    \ web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
