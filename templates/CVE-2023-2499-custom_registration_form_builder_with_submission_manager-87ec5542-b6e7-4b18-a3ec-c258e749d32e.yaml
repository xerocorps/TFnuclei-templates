  description: 'The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 5.2.1.0. This is due to insufficient
    verification on the user being supplied during a Google social login through the
    plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any
    existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the
    email.
