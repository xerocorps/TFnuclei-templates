  description: 'The Maspik plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization
    in version 2.5.6 and prior. This is due to missing capability checks on the Maspik_spamlog_download_csv
    function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    access and above, to export and download the spam log database containing blocked
    submission attempts, which may include misclassified but legitimate submissions
    with sensitive data.
