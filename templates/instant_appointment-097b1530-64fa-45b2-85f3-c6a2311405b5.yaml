  description: 'The Instant Appointment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''insapp_upload_image_as_attachment''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server
    which may make remote code execution possible.
