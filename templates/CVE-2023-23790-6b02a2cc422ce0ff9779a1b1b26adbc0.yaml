  description: 'The Pods plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.10.2. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation when deleting pods. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete pods via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
