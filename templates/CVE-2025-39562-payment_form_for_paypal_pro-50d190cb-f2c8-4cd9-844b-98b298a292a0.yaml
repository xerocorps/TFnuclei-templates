  description: 'The Payment Form for PayPal Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1.72 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
