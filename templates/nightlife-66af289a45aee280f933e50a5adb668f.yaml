  description: 'The Nightlife Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload-file.php file in all
    known versions. This makes it possible for [authentication-level] attackers unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make
    remote code execution possible.
