  description: 'The Student Results or Employee Database plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized REST calls in versions up to, and including 1.7.9. This is due
    to flawed permission callback in the plugin''s REST endpoints. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to utilize these endpoints to add, modify or delete
    students
