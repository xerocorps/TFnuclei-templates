  description: 'The Child Theme Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerability to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7 due to insufficient
    nonce validation on the section_remove function. This makes it possible for attackers
    to delete arbitrary folders on the affected site, if they can successfully trick
    a site''s administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
