  description: 'The EventON Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data due to a missing capability check in the ''assets/lib/settings/settings.js''
    file in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.6. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability
    was partially patched in version 4.9.6.
