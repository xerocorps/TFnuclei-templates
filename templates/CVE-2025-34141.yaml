  description: 'A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ETQ
    Reliance CG (legacy) platform within the SQLConverterServlet component. This vulnerability
    requires user interaction, such as clicking a crafted link, and may result in
    execution of unauthorized scripts in the user''s context. The affected servlet
    was unnecessarily exposed to authenticated users and has since been disabled in
    version SE.2025.1.

    '
  impact: 'Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript
    in the context of an authenticated user''s browser session, potentially leading
    to session hijacking or unauthorized actions.
