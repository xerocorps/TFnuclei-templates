  description: 'The Uncanny Toolkit for LearnDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.6.3. This is
    due to missing  nonce validation on several functions such as the ajax_activate_deactivate_module
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin
    settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
