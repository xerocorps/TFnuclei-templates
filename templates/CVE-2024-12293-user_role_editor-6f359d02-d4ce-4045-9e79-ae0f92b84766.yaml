  description: 'The User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.64.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the update_roles() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove roles for arbitrary users, including
    escalating their privileges to administrator, via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
