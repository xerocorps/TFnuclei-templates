  description: 'The Order Export & Order Import for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in
    the upload_import_file function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access
    and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may
    make remote code execution possible.
