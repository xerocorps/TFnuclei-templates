  description: 'The Player Leaderboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local
    File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 via the ''player_leaderboard''
    shortcode. This is due to the plugin using an unsanitized user-supplied value
    from the shortcode''s ''mode'' attribute in a call to include() without proper
    path validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
    access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing
    the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access
    controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve full remote code execution if combined
    with file upload capabilities.
