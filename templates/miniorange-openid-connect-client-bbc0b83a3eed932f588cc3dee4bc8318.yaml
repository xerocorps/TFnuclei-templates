  description: The WordPress OpenID Connect Client plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including 2.1.7. This is due to
    the plugin accepting a user supplied email address that is passed to wp_set_auth_cookie()
    with no further identity validation to verify that the email supplied belongs
    to the user trying to log in with that email address. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to log in as a site administrator granted they have
    access to a site admin's email address.
