  description: "The Forminator \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder\
    \ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'redirect-url'\
    \ field located in the form submission settings in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.26.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions\
    \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
    \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations\
    \ and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
