  description: 'The FlyingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass due to a missing capability check on its AJAX actions in versions up to,
    and including, 3.9.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    subscriber-level permissions and above, to interact with the plugin in ways administrators
    are intended to. One action (save_config) allows for the configuration of an external
    CDN. This could be used to include malicious javascript from a source controlled
    by the attacker.
