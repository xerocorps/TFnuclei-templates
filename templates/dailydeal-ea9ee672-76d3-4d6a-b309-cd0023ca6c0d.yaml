  description: 'The Daily Deal theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation via the /monetize/upload/ directory
    in unknown versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
