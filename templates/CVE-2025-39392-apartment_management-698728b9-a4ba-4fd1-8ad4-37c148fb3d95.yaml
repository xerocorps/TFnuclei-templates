  description: 'The WPAMS - Apartment Management System for wordpress plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including,
    44.0 (17-08-2023) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
