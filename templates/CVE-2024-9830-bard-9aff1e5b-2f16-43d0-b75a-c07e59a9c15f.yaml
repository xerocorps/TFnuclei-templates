  description: 'The Bard theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the
    URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.216. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
