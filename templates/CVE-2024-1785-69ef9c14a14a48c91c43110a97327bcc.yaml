  description: 'The Contests by Rewards Fuel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.62. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_handler() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s settings
    and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a
    site''s user with the edit_posts capability into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
