  description: miniOrange's Google Authenticator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on an the mo_wpns_malware_redirect
    function in versions up to, and including, 5.5.82. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to initiate/terminate
    malware scans or obtain the malware scan status of a currently ongoing or the
    last scan. Terminating ongoing scans could aid an attacker who is attempting to
    infect a site, while repeatedly initiating new scans could lead to resource exhaustion.
    Additionally, knowing the status of the last scan might help an attacker who wishes
    to further compromise a site or server.
