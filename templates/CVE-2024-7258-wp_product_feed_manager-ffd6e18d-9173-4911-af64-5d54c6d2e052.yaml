  description: 'The WooCommerce Google Feed Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the ''wppfm_removeFeedFile''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
