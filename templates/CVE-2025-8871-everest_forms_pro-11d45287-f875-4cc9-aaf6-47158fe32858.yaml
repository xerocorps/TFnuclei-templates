  description: 'The Everest Forms (Pro) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
    Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.7 via deserialization
    of untrusted input in the mime_content_type() function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be
    exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with
    a non-required signature form field along with an image upload field. No known
    POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability
    has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed
    on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
    on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete
    arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP
    chain present. This vulnerability is only exploitable in PHP versions prior to
    8.
