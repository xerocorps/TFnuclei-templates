  description: 'The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload (Pro) - WooCommerce plugin
    for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type
    validation in the dnd_upload_cf7_upload_chunks() function in version 5.0 - 5.0.5
    (when bundled with the PrintSpace theme) and all versions up to, and including,
    1.7.1 (in the standalone version). This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible. The execution of PHP is disabled via a .htaccess
    file but is still possible in certain server configurations. CVE-2025-49885 may
    be a duplicate of this.
