  description: 'The Bulk Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including,
    1.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
    access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which
    may make remote code execution possible.
