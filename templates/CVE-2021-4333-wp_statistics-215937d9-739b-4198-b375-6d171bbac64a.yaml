  description: 'The WP Statistics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 13.1.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the view() function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins, via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
