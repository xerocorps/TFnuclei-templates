  description: "The Gutenberg Blocks, Page Builder \u2013 ComboBlocks plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Accordion block\
    \ in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.87 due to insufficient input sanitization\
    \ and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for\
    \ authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject\
    \ arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an\
    \ injected page.\n"
