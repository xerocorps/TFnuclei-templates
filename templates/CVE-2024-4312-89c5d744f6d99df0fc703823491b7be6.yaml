    \ is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.12. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when saving match\
    \ and team settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change\
    \ plugin settings as well as teams, players, etc. via a forged request granted\
    \ they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking\
    \ on a link.\n"
