  description: 'The WP Full Stripe Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.1. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation via several functions in the ~/include/wp-full-stripe-admin-menu.php
    file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin''s
    settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
    performing an action such as clicking on a link.
