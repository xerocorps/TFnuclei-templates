  description: 'The GTM Server Side plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping
    on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.19. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
    if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
