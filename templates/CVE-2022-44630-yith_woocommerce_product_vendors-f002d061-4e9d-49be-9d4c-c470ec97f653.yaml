  description: 'Several YITHEMES plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the create_log_file
    function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create an error
    or debug log file using the plugin, via forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The
    function allows the user to specify the file name. Please note that the unpatched
    plugins from this developer are the FREE versions of the plugin that were available
    on the WordPress.org repository. The developer is still maintaining the premium
    versions of the plugins which have been patched.
