  description: 'The WP DB Booster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing
    nonce validation on the cleanup_all AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to delete database records including post drafts, revisions, comments,
    and metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
    into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
