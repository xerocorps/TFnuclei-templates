  description: Aegir is a Web hosting control panel program that provides a Drupal-based
    graphical interface designed to simplify deploying, managing and upgrading an
    entire network of Drupal, Wordpress and CiviCRM Web sites. The Hosting HTTPS module
    is a commonly used piece of the Aegir platform. This module doesnt sufficiently
    shield multi-site installations. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that
    the server must be using Apache and must host multiple sites on a common platform.
    An attacker must have a knowledge about used filenames and the server.
