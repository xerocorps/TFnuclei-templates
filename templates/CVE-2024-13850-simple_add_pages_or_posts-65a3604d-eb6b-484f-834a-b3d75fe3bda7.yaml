  description: 'The Simple add pages or posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
    This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
    has been disabled.
