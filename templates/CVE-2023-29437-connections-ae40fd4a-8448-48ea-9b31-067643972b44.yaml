  description: 'The Connections Business Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''connections'' and ''upcoming_list'' shortcodes
    in versions up to, and including, 10.4.36 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
    will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
