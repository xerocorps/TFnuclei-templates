  description: 'The TablePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection
    in versions up to and including 1.14 via the tablepress[data] value. This makes
    it possible for attackers with author level access and above to embed untrusted
    input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files
    are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration. This
    vulnerability is not likely to be exploited in the wild due to its high complexity
    and many modern day protections, however, it could have a significant impact if
    exploited successfully at it''s worst impact. Please note that while the CVE record
    says this issue was patched in 1.10, our team confirmed it was still exploitable
    in 1.14. The has been patched in version 2.0 of TablePress.
