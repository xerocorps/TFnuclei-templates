  description: "The WP Easy Gallery \u2013 WordPress Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'edit_imageId' and 'edit_imageDelete'\
    \ parameters in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5 due to insufficient escaping\
    \ on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing\
    \ SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level\
    \ access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries\
    \ that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n"
