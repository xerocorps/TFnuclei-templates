  description: 'The OneClick Chat to Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure
    Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 via the ''wa_order_thank_you_override''
    function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive customer information including
    names, email addresses, phone numbers, billing/shipping addresses, order contents,
    and payment methods by simply changing the order ID in the URL.
