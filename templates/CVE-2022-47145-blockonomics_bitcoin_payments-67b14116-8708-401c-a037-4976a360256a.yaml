  description: "The WordPress Bitcoin Payments \u2013 Blockonomics plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018filter_by\u2019\
    \ parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.5.7 due to insufficient input\
    \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can\
    \ successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
