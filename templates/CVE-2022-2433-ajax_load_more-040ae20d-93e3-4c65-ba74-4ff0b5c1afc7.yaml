  description: "The WordPress Infinite Scroll \u2013 Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'alm_repeaters_export'\
    \ parameter in versions up to, and including 5.5.3. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick\
    \ a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link, that\
    \ will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform\
    \ a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also\
    \ requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized\
    \ payload.\n"
