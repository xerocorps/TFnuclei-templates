  description: The Titan Anti-spam & Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.1 due to insufficient
    input sanitization and output escaping on the `antspm-q` and `antspm-e-email-url-website`
    parameters. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    that execute in a victim's browser.
