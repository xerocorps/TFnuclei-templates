  description: 'The TI WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the tinvwl_upload_file_wc_fields_factory()
    function which has ''test_type'' for ''wp_handle_upload'' set to false in all
    versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
    remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable when the WC Fields Factory
    plugin is also installed and enabled.
