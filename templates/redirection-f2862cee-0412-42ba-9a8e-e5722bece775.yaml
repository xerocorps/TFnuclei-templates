  description: 'The Redirection plugin suffers from a critical Cross-Site Request
    Forgery vulnerability that allows remote attackers to create a file on the target
    server and execute arbitrary code.  The attack requires an administrator visit
    a malicious website set up by the attacker, but does not require more interaction
    nor do they have to click on anything on the malicious website in order to trigger
    the exploit.
