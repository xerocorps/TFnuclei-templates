  description: 'The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
    file uploads via the ''class_fma_connector.php'' file in all versions up to, and
    including, 5.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload a new
    .htaccess file allowing them to subsequently upload arbitrary files on the affected
    site''s server which may make remote code execution possible.
