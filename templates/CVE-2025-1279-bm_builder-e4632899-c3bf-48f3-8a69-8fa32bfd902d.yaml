  description: 'The BM Content Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability
    check on the ux_cb_tools_import_item_ajax AJAX action in all versions up to, and
    including, 3.16.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
    Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
    site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator
    and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
    to a vulnerable site.
