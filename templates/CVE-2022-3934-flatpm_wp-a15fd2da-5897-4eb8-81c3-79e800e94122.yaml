  description: 'The Flat PM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
    Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.661 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping on the block_cat_ID value. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
