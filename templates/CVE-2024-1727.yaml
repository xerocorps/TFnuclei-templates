  description: To prevent malicious 3rd party websites from making requests to Gradio
    applications running locally, this PR tightens the CORS rules around Gradio applications.
    In particular, it checks to see if the host header is localhost (or one of its
    aliases) and if so, it requires the origin header (if present) to be localhost
    (or one of its aliases) as well.
