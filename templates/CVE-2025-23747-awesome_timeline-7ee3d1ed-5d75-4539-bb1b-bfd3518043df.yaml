  description: 'The Awesome WordPress Timeline Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1 due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject
    arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
    page.
