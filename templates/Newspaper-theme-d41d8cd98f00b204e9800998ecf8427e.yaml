  description: 'The Newspaper theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
    in versions up to, and including, 9.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
    and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
