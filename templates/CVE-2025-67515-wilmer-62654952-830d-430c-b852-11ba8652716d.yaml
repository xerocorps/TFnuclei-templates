  description: "The Wilm\xEBr theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion\
    \ in versions up to 3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on\
    \ the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can\
    \ be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where images and other \"safe\" file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
