  description: 'The The Affiliate Super Assistent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.3.
    This is due to the software allowing users to supply arbitrary shortcodes in comments
    when the ''Parse comments'' option is enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
