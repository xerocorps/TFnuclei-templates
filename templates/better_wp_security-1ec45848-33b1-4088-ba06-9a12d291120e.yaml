  description: 'The Better WP Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the ''inc/secure.php'' file in versions up to, and including,
    3.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on logged data.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
