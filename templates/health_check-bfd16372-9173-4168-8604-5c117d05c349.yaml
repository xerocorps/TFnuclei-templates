  description: 'The Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers to call AJAX actions (vulnerable actions listed in resource) via forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link.
