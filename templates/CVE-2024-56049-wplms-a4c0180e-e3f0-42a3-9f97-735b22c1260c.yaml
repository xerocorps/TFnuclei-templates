  description: 'The WPLMS Learning Management System for WordPress, WordPress LMS
    theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient
    file path validation in in all versions up to 1.9.9.5.2 (exclusive). This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
    to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code
    execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
