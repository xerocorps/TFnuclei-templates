    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.5.6.2. This is due to
    missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
