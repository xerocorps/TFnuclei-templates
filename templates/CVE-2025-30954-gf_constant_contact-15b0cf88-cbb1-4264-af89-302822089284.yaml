  description: 'The WP Gravity Forms Constant Contact Plugin plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This
    is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url supplied. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites
    if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
