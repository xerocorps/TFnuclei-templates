  description: 'The Mojoomla School Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to SQL Injection via the ''id'' parameter in unknown versions due to insufficient
    escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on
    the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
    student-level access to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries
    that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
