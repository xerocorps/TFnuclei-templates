  description: "The BackWPup \u2013 WordPress Backup & Restore Plugin plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check\
    \ on the 'backwpup_working' AJAX action in versions 5 through 5.5.0. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,\
    \ to retrieve access to a back-up's filename while a backup is running. This information\
    \ has little value on it's own, but could be used to aid in a brute force attack\
    \ to retrieve back-up contents in limited environments (i.e. NGINX).\n"
