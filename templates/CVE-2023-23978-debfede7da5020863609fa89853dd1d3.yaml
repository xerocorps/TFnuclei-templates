  description: 'The WP Client Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive
    Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.0.16 via the wp_client_reports_send_email_report_from_ajax()
    function due to a missing capability check. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to extract sensitive data,
    including information stored in client reports. Please note that this still appears
    to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery.
