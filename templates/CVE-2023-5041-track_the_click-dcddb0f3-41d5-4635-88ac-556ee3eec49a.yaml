  description: 'The Track The Click plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based
    SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 0.3.11 due to insufficient escaping
    on user supplied data submitted via the ''stats'' REST endpoint and lack of sufficient
    preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries
    into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
    from the database. NOTE: This issue was partially fixed in 0.3.11 and completely
    fixed in 0.3.12.
