    \ featuring kanban board and gantt charts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to\
    \ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 2.6.22 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\
    \ in tasks discussion. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator,\
    \ to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
    \ the SVG file.\n"
