  description: The Noo JobMonster theme is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Disclosure
    via Directory Listing in the /wp-content/uploads/jobmonster/ folder, as it did
    not include a default PHP file, or .htaccess file in versions up to, and including
    4.6.6. This could expose personal data such as people's resumes. Although Directory
    Listing can be prevented by securely configuring the web server, vendors can also
    take measures to make it less likely to happen.
