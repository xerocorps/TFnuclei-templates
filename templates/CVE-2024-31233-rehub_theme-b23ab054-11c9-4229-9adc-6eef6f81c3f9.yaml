  description: 'The Rehub theme for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions
    up to, and including, 19.6.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
    parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes
    it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
    to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
    to extract sensitive information from the database.
