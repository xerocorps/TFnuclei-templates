  description: The Lazyest Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via the 'xml_or_all' parameter found in the lazyest-backup.php
    file in versions up to 0.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
    escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
