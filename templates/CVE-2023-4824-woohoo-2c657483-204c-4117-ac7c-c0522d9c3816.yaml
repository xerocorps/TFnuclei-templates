  description: 'The WooHoo Newspaper Magazine Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the /wp-admin/admin.php?page=mypanel&do=submit
    page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin''s
    settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
