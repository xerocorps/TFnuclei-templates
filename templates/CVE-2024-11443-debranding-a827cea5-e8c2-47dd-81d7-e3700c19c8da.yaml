  description: 'The de:branding plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability
    check on the debranding_save() function in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
    access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can
    be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and
    enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a
    vulnerable site.
