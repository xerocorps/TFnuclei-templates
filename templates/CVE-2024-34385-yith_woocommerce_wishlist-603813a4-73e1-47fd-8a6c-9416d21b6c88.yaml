  description: 'The YITH WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to 3.33.0 (exclusive)
    due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to
    inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
