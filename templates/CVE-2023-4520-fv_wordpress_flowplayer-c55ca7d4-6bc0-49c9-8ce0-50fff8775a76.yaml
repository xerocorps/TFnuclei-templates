  description: "The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018_fv_player_user_video\u2019 parameter\
    \ saved via the 'save' function hooked via init, and the plugin is also vulnerable\
    \ to Arbitrary Usermeta Update via the 'save' function in versions up to, and\
    \ including, 7.5.37.7212 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page,\
    \ and makes it possible to update the user metas arbitrarily, but the meta value\
    \ can only be a string.\n"
