  description: 'The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,
    1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the upload and
    delete_file functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    perform an unauthorized file upload or deletion via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
