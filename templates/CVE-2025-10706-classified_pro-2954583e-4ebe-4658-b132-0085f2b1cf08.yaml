  description: 'The Classified Pro theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    plugin installation due to a missing capability check in the ''cwp_addons_update_plugin_cb''
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install
    arbitrary plugins on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible. Note: The required nonce for the vulnerability is in the CubeWP Framework
    plugin.
