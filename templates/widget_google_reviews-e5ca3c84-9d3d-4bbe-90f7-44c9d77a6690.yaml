  description: 'The Plugin for Google Reviews for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on the save function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to create widgets, via forged request granted they can
    trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
