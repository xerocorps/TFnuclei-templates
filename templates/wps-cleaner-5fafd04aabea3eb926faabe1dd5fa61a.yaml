  description: 'The WPS Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
    bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This is due to missing capability
    and nonce checks on 7 different functions found in the ''/classes/plugin.php''
    file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions,
    such as a subscriber, to perform a variety of actions such as deleting arbitrary
    files, creating zip archives, deleting zip archives, and deleting alerts among
    some additional actions.
