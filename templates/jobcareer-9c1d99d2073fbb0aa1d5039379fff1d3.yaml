  description: 'The JobCareer | Job Board Responsive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to both authenticated Stored and unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
    in versions up to, and including, 3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping. The Reflected XSS is vulnerable to the following parameters:
    ''job_title'', ''specialisms'', and ''location'' while the Stored XSS is vulnerable
    to the (Complete Address) text field. This makes it possible for attackers to
    inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim''s browser.
