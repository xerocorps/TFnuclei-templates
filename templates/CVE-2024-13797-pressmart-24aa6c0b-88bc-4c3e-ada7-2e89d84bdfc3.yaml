  description: 'The PressMart - Modern Elementor WooCommerce WordPress Theme theme
    for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up
    to, and including, 1.2.16. This is due to the software allowing users to execute
    an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
