  description: "The Classified Listing \u2013 Classified ads & Business Directory\
    \ Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 3.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce\
    \ validation on the 'rtcl_update_user_account' function. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to change the administrator user's password and\
    \ email address via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This locks the administrator\
    \ out of the site and prevents them from resetting their password, while granting\
    \ the attacker access to their account.\n"
