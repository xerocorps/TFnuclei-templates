  description: 'The 1-Click Login: Passwordless Authentication plugin for WordPress
    is vulnerable to authentication bypass in version 1.4.5. This is due to the plugin
    not properly verifying a user''s identity prior to authenticating them. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators,
    granted they have access to an email.
