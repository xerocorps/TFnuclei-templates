  description: "The Ninja Forms Contact Form \u2013 The Drag and Drop Form Builder\
    \ for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to code injection in versions\
    \ up to, and including 3.6.10 due to insufficient validation on Merge Tags that\
    \ makes it possible to call arbitrary Ninja Form classes. This could lead to a\
    \ variety of actions, however, one notable one is deserialization when the NF_Admin_Processes_ImportForm::startup\
    \ method is called.  On sites with a POP chain this could be used to achieve remote\
    \ code execution in the worst possible scenarios.\n"
