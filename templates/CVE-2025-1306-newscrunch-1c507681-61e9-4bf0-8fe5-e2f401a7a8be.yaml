  description: 'The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin() function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
