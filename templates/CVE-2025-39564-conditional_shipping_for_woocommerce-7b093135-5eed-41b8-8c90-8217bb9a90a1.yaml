  description: 'The Conditional Shipping for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.0. This
    is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
