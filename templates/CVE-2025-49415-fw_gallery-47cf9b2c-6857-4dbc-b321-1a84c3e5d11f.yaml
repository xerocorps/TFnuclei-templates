  description: "The FW Gallery \u2013 Photo, video, audio media presentation and management\
    \ system with players and slideshow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary\
    \ file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in a function in all\
    \ versions up to, and including, 8.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to\
    \ remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).\n"
