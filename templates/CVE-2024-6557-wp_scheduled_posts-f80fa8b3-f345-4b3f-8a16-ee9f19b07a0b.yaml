  description: "The SchedulePress \u2013 Auto Post & Publish, Auto Social Share, Schedule\
    \ Posts with Editorial Calendar & Missed Schedule Post Publisher plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 5.1.3. This is due the plugin utilizing the wpdeveloper library and leaving\
    \ the demo files in place with display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used\
    \ to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and\
    \ requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.\n"
