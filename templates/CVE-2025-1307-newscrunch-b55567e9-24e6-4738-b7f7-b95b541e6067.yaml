  description: 'The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to a missing capability check in the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4.1. This makes it possible
    for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
