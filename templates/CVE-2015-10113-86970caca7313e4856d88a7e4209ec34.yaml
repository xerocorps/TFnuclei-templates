  description: 'The WooFramework Tweaks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
    Cross-Site Scripting via a URL in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and the use of add_query_arg.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
    in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link. Please note that the CVE has this recorded
    as an Open Redirect, however, this patch is related to Cross-Site Scripting.
