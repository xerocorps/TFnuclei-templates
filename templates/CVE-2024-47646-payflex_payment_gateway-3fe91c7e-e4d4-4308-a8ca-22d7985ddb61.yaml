  description: 'The Payflex Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.1. This is due to insufficient
    validation on a redirect url supplied. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully
    trick them into performing an action.
