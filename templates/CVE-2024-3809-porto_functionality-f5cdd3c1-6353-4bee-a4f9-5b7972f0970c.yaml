  description: 'The Porto Theme - Functionality plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.9 via the ''slideshow_type''
    post meta. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
    and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing
    the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access
    controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php
    file type can be uploaded and included.
