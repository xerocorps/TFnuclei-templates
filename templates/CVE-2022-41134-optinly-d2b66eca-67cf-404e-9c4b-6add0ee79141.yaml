  description: 'The Optinly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.15. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to modify plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick
    a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Note
    the developer attempted to patch the issue, however, the plugin is still vulnerable
    by simply omitting the `csrfToken` value.
