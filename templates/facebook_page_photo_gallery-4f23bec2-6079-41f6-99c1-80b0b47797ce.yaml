  description: 'The Facebook Page Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the inclusion of a vulnerable version
    of prettyPhoto in versions up to, and including, 2.0.9 due to insufficient input
    sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully
    trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
