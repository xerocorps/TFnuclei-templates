  description: 'The Database for Contact Form 7, WPforms, Elementor forms plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,
    1.4.3 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_lead_detail function.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The
    additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin, which is likely
    to be used alongside, allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, leading to a
    denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.
