  description: 'Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress using Smart Framework
    are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to a missing capability check
    on the saveOptions() and importThemeOptions() functions in various versions. This
    makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
    above, to update the plugin''s settings which includes custom JavaScript that
    is enabled site-wide. This issue was escalated to Envato over two months from
    the date of this disclosure and the issue is still vulnerable.
