  description: 'The WP EasyCart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.4.8. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the process_delete_product function. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to delete products via a forged request granted
    they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
    on a link.
