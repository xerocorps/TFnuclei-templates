  description: 'The WP Google My Business Auto Publish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcodes in versions up to,
    and including, 3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
    on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
    with contributor level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
    pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page
