  description: 'The Spotlight Social Media Feeds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.10. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the AuthCallbackListener class.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to connect accounts via a
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
