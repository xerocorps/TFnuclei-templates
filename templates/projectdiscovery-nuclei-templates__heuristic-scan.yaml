  description: 'Fortinet heuristic scanning configuration is advised to thwart attacks.
    Heuristic scanning is a technique used to identify previously unknown viruses.
    A value of block enables heuristic AV scanning of binary files and blocks any
    detected. A replacement message is forwarded to the recipient, and blocked files
    are quarantined if quarantine is enabled.
