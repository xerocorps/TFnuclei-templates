  description: 'The WooCommerce Weight Based Shipping plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.4.1. This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to create and delete weight based shipping rules via a forged request
    granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
    clicking on a link.
