  description: "The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018content\u2019\
    \ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and\
    \ including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due\
    \ to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible\
    \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that\
    \ execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such\
    \ as clicking on a link. NOTE: The three variations of this software (Business,\
    \ Developer, and Agency) share the same plugin slug, so you may get an alert even\
    \ if you are running the latest version of any of the pieces of software. In these\
    \ cases it is safe to dismiss the notice once you've confirmed your site is on\
    \ a patched version of the applicable software.\n"
