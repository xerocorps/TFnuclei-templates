  description: "The Doubly \u2013 Cross Domain Copy Paste for WordPress plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.0.46 via deserialization of untrusted input from the content.txt file within\
    \ uploaded ZIP archives. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
    \ Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence\
    \ of a POP chain allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, delete files, retrieve\
    \ sensitive data, or perform other actions depending on the available gadgets.\
    \ This is only exploitable by subscribers, when administrators have explicitly\
    \ enabled that access.\n"
