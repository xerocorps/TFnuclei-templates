  description: 'The SVG Case Study plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
