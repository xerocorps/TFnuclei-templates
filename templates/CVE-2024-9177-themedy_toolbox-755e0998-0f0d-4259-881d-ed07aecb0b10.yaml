  description: 'The Themedy Toolbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via the plugin''s themedy_col, themedy_social_link, themedy_alertbox,
    and themedy_pullleft shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14,
    and up to, and including 1.0.15 for the plugin''s themedy_button shortcode due
    to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
