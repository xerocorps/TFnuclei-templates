  description: 'Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 Configuration Backup Missing Authentication
    Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
    attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Deep
    Sea Electronics DSE855 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this
    vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the web-based UI. The issue results
    from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An
    attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading
    to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-22679.

    '
  impact: 'Unauthenticated network-adjacent attackers can download configuration backup
    files containing stored credentials without authentication.
