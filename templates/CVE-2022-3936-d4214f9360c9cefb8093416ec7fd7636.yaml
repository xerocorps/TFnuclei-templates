  description: 'The Team Members plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
    Scripting via some of its settings parameters in versions up to, and including,
    5.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
