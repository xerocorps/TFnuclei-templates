  description: 'The Vite Coupon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to execute arbitrary code on the server via a forged request granted they can
    trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
