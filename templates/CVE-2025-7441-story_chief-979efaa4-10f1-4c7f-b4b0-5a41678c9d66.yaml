  description: 'The StoryChief plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.42. This vulnerability occurs
    through the /wp-json/storychief/webhook REST-API endpoint that does not have sufficient
    filetype validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
    arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make remote code execution
    possible.
