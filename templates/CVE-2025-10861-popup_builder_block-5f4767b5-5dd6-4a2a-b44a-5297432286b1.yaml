  description: 'The Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level
    Targeting, and WooCommerce Triggers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side
    Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to insufficient
    validation on the URLs supplied via the URL parameter. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating
    from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from
    internal services, as well as conduct network reconnaissance. The vulnerability
    was partially patched in version 2.1.4.
