  description: 'The AppPresser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation on the force_logging_off() function. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to turn logging off via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
