  description: "The WP Insurance \u2013 WordPress Insurance Service Plugin plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to,\
    \ and including, 2.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on\
    \ the 'plugin_activation' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed (but deactivated)\
    \ on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator\
    \ into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
