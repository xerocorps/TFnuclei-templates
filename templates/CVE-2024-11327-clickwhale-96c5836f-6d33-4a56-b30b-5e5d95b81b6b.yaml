  description: "The ClickWhale \u2013 Link Manager, Link Shortener and Click Tracker\
    \ for Affiliate Links & Link Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg & remove_query_arg without\
    \ appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing\
    \ an action such as clicking on a link.\n"
