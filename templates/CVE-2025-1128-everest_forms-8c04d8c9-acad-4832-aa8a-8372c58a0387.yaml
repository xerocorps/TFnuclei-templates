  description: "The Everest Forms \u2013 Contact Forms, Quiz, Survey, Newsletter &\
    \ Payment Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary\
    \ file upload, read, and deletion due to missing file type and path validation\
    \ in the 'format' method of the EVF_Form_Fields_Upload class in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 3.0.9.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
    \ to upload, read, and delete arbitrary files on the affected site's server which\
    \ may make remote code execution, sensitive information disclosure, or a site\
    \ takeover possible.\n"
