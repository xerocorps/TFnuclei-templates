  description: 'The WP Cerber Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Protection
    bypass in versions up to, and including 9.4 due to the plugin improperly checking
    for a visitor''s IP address. This makes it possible for an attacker whose IP address
    has been blocked to bypass this control by setting the X-Forwarded-For: HTTP header
    to an IP Address that hasn''t been blocked.
