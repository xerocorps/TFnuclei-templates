  description: 'In the GetPaid WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, users with the contributor
    role and above can create a new Payment Form, however the Label and Help Text
    input fields were not getting sanitized properly. So it was possible to inject
    malicious content such as img tags, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue
    which is triggered when the form will be edited, for example when an admin reviews
    it and could lead to privilege escalation.
