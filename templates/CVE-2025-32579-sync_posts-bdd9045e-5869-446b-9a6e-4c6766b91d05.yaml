  description: 'The Sync Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
    uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''scwp_sync_posts_func'' and
    ''scwp_download_posts_content_images'' functions in all versions up to, and including,
    1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
    access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which
    may make remote code execution possible.
