  description: "The WP Travel Engine \u2013 Tour Booking Plugin \u2013 Tour Operator\
    \ Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions\
    \ up to, and including, 6.6.7 via the mode parameter. This makes it possible for\
    \ unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the\
    \ server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used\
    \ to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution\
    \ in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
