  description: 'The Customily Product Personalizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via user cookies in all versions up to, and including,
    1.23.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
    that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. We unfortunately
    could not get in touch with the vendor through various means to disclose this
    issue.
