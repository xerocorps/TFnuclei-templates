  description: "The File Manager Pro \u2013 Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the\
    \ 'njt_fs_saveSettingRestrictions' function in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 1.8.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with a role that\
    \ has been granted permissions by an Administrator, to update the plugin settings\
    \ for user role restrictions, including allowing file types such as .php to be\
    \ uploaded.\n"
