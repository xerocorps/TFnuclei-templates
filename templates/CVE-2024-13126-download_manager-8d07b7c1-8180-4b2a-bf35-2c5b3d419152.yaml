  description: 'The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.06. This is due to plugin
    not providing any access restrictions to the direct in which download files are
    uploaded. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access downloads
    that should be password protected by downloading them straight from the directory.
