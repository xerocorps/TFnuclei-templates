  description: "The WordPress Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\
    \ to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the mo_sharing_app_value\
    \ function as well as others that are reachable via AJAX action in versions up\
    \ to, and including, 7.5.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change plugin settings. \nAdditionally,\
    \ some AJAX actions were missing nonce checks thus making them vulnerable to Cross-Site\
    \ Request Forgery. This enables unauthenticated attackers to invoke the corresponding\
    \ functions, granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action\
    \ such as clicking on a link.\n"
