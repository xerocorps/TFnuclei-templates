  description: "The LearnPress \u2013 WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is\
    \ vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 4.2.6.3 due to missing validation on a user controlled key when looking up order\
    \ information. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to obtain information\
    \ on orders placed by other users and guests, which can be leveraged to sign up\
    \ for paid courses that were purchased by guests. Emails of other users are also\
    \ exposed.\n"
