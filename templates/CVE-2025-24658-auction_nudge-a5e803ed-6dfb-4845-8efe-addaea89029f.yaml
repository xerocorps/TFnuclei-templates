  description: "The Auction Nudge \u2013 Your eBay on Your Site plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including,\
    \ 7.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes\
    \ it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and\
    \ above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a\
    \ user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and\
    \ installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\n"
