  description: 'The Advanced Control Manager for WordPress by ItalyStrap plugin for
    WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and
    including, 2.16.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
    and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
    a user accesses an injected page.
