  description: 'The WooCommerce Point of Sale plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0. This is due
    to insufficient validation on the ''logged_in_user_id'' value when option values
    are empty and the ability for attackers to change the email of arbitrary user
    accounts. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the email
    of arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, and reset their password
    to gain access to the account.
