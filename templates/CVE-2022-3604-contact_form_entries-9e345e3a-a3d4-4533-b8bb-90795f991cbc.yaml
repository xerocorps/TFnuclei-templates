  description: 'The Contact Form Entries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV
    Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9 when outputting to a CSV file.
    This allows low-level attackers to embed untrusted input contact forms that will
    be present in exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these
    files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
