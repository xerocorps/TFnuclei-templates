  description: 'The Serial Codes Generator and Validator with WooCommerce Support
    plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions
    up to, and including, 2.7.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
    on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform
    an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
