  description: 'The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Insecure
    Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 7.5.4. This is due to
    improper validation and authorization checks within the listing_task function.
    This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
    and above, to delete arbitrary posts. Please note CVE-2023-35052 appears to be
