  description: 'The Cloudflare Image Resizing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    Remote Code Execution due to missing authentication and insufficient sanitization
    within its hook_rest_pre_dispatch() method in all versions up to, and including,
    1.5.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
    PHP into the codebase, achieving remote code execution.
