  description: 'The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.2.5 due to
    insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
    web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
