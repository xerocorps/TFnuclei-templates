  description: 'The Service Finder SMS System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due
    to the plugin not verifying a user''s phone number before logging them in. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as arbitrary users.
