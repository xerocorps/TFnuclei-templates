  description: 'The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.31. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on multiple AJAX functions. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to approve, decline, and block affiliate applications
    and manage affiliate status via a forged request granted they can trick a site
    administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
