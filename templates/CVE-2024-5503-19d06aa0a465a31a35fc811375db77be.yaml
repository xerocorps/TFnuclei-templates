  description: "The WP Blog Post Layouts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local\
    \ File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This makes it possible\
    \ for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include\
    \ and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any\
    \ PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain\
    \ sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201C\
    safe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
