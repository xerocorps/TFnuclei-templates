  description: 'The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.11.7 . This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation when deleting payment history. Additionally, the
    plugin does not ensure that the item about to be deleted is payment history. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts, via
    forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
    action such as clicking on a link.
