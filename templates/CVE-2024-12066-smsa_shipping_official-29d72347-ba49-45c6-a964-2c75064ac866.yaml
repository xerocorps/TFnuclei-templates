  classification:
    cve-id: CVE-2024-12066
    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: 'The SMSA Shipping(official) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the smsa_delete_label()
    function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3. This makes it possible for
    authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary
    files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
    file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). CVE-2024-49249 is likely a duplicate
    of this issue.
