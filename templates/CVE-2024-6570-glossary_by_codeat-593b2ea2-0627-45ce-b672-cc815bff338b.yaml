  description: 'The Glossary plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure
    in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.26. This is due the plugin utilizing
    wpdesk and not preventing direct access to the test files along with display_errors
    being enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve
    the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks.
    The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability
    to be present for damage to an affected website.
