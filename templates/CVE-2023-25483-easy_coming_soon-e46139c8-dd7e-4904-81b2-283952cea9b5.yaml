  description: 'The Easy Coming Soon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
    Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin settings in versions up to, and including,
    2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
    possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above,
    to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
    an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations
    where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
