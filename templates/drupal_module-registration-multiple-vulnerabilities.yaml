  author: Bishopfox
  description: 'This module enables you to take registrations for events, gathering
    information from registrants including email address and any other questions you
    wish to configure.  In some cases, an anonymous user may view, edit, or delete
    other anonymous registrations by guessing the URL of that registration based on
    a simple pattern. If anonymous users are allowed to register and:  anonymous users
    have the View permission, information included in the registration can be accessed.
    anonymous users have the Edit permission, information included in the registration
    can be altered. anonymous users have the Delete permission, the registration itself
    can be deleted.   This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only applies
    to cases where the anonymous user role has specifically been given View, Edit,
    or Delete access to the specific Registration Type.'
