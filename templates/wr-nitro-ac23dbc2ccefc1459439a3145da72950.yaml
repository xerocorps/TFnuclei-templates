  description: The Nitro by WooRockets theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
    Plugin Installation in versions up to, and including, 1.7.9. This is due to missing
    authorization checks on some of its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to install arbitrary plugins on the vulnerable service, adding unwanted
    plugins and potentially overwriting stored data.
