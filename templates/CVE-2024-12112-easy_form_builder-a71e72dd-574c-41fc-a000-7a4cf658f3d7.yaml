  description: "The Easy Form Builder \u2013 WordPress plugin form builder: contact\
    \ form, survey form, payment form, and custom form builder plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'name' parameter of the\
    \ 'add_form_Emsfb' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.8 due\
    \ to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and missing authorization\
    \ checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level\
    \ access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
