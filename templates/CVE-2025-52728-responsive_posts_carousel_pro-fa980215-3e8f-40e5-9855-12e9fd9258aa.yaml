  description: "The Responsive Posts Carousel WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress\
    \ is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 15.0.\
    \ This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access\
    \ and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the\
    \ execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access\
    \ controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images\
    \ and other \u201Csafe\u201D file types can be uploaded and included.\n"
