  description: 'The LeadSnap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
    in versions up to, and including, 1.23 via deserialization of untrusted input
    in the nopriv_tve_api_form_submit AJAX action. This allows unauthenticated attackers
    to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a
    POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
    system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
    data, or execute code.
