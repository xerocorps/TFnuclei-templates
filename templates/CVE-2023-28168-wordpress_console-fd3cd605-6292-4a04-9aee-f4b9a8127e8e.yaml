  description: 'The WordPress Console plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
    modification of data and execution of files due to missing authorization in several
    files such as reload.php, complete.php, and query that is also missing direct
    file access controls in versions up to, and including, 0.3.9. This makes it possible
    for unauthenticated attackers to unset the ''$_SESSION[''console_vars'']'' and
    ''$_SESSION[''partial'']'' variables and potentially achieve remote code execution
    if they can successfully exploit the type juggling weakness in query.php.
