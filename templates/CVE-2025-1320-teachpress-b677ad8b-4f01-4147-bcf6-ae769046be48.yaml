  description: 'The teachPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.9. This is due to missing or
    incorrect nonce validation on the import.php page. This makes it possible for
    unauthenticated attackers to delete imports via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
