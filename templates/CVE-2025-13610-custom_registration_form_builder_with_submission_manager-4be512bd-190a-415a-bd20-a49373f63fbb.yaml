  description: "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration,\
    \ Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site\
    \ Scripting via the plugin's 'RM_Forms' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,\
    \ 6.0.6.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'theme'\
    \ attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor\
    \ level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute\
    \ whenever a user accesses an injected page.\n"
