  description: 'The Auction Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing
    or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they
    can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
    link.
