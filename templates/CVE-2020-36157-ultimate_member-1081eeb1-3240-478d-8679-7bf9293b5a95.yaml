  description: 'An issue was discovered in the Ultimate Member plugin before 2.1.12
    for WordPress, aka Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Roles. Due to
    the lack of filtering on the role parameter that could be supplied during the
    registration process, an attacker could supply the role parameter with a WordPress
    capability (or any custom Ultimate Member role) and effectively be granted those
    privileges.
