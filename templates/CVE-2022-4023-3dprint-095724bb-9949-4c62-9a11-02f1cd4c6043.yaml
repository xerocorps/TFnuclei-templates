  description: 'The 3DPrint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.6.9. This is due to missing or incorrect
    nonce validation in the tinyfilemanager.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to create a backup of any file or directory on the site via a forged
    request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
    such as clicking on a link. File backups are stored with a predictable name (prepending
    a timestamp) in a known location which adds a trivial amount of complexity.
