  description: "The FileOrganizer \u2013 Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin\
    \ for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type\
    \ validation in the \"fileorganizer_ajax_handler\" function in all versions up\
    \ to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
    \ with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an administrator,\
    \ to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote\
    \ code execution possible. NOTE: The FileOrganizer Pro plugin must be installed\
    \ and active to allow Subscriber+ users to upload files.\n"
