    cvss-score: 8.8
  description: "The Greenshift \u2013 animation and page builder blocks plugin for\
    \ WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation\
    \ in the gspb_make_proxy_api_request() function in versions 11.4 to 11.4.5. This\
    \ makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access\
    \ and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may\
    \ make remote code execution possible. The arbitrary file upload was sufficiently\
    \ patched in 11.4.5, but a capability check was added in 11.4.6 to properly prevent\
    \ unauthorized limited file uploads.\n"
