  description: 'The Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is
    vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s shortcode(s) in all
    versions up to, and including, 1.25 due to insufficient input sanitization and
    output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
    attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
    scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
