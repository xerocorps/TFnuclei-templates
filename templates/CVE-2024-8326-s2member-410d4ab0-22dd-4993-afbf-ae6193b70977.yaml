  description: "The s2Member \u2013 Excellent for All Kinds of Memberships, Content\
    \ Restriction Paywalls & Member Access Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable\

    \ including user data and database configuration information, which can lead to\
    \ reading, updating, or dropping database tables. The vulnerability was partially\
    \ patched in version 241114.\n"
