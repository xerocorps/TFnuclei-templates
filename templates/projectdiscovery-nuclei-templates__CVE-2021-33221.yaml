  description: CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller is susceptible to information disclosure
    vulnerabilities because a 'service details' API endpoint discloses system and
    configuration information to an attacker without requiring authentication. This
    information includes DNS and NTP servers that the devices use for time and host
    resolution. It also includes the internal hostname and IoT Controller version.
    A fully configured device in production may leak other, more sensitive information
    (API keys and tokens).
  impact: 'Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the exposure
    of sensitive data, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized access.
