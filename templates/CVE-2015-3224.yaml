  description: Ruby on Rails Web Console before 2.1.3, as used with Ruby on Rails
    3.x and 4.x, does not properly restrict the use of X-Forwarded-For headers in
    determining a client's IP address, which allows remote attackers to bypass the
    whitelisted_ips protection mechanism via a crafted request to request.rb.
