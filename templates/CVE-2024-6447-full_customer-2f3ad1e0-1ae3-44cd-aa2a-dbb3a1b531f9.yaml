  description: "The FULL \u2013 Cliente plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored\
    \ Cross-Site Scripting via the license plan parameter in all versions up to, and\
    \ including, 3.1.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping\
    \ as well as missing authorization and capability checks on the related functions.\
    \ This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web\
    \ scripts that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses wp-admin\
    \ dashboard\n"
