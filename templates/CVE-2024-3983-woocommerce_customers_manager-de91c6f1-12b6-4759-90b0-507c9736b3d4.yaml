  description: 'The WooCommerce Customers Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to 30.1 (exclusive). This is
    due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ''woocommerce-customers-manager''
    page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete customers
    via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
    an action such as clicking on a link.
