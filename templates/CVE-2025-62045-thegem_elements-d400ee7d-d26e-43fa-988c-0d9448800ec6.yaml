  description: 'The TheGem Theme Elements (for WPBakery) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
    to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 5.10.5.1. This makes
    it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files
    on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can
    be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution
    in cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and included.
