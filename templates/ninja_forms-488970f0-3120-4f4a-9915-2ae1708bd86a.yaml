  description: "The Ninja Forms Contact Form \u2013 The Drag and Drop Form Builder\
    \ for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery\
    \ in versions up to, and including 3.6.9, due to missing nonce validation on the\
    \ import_fields_listener() function that makes it possible for unauthenticated\
    \ attackers to import new form fields granted that can trick an attacker into\
    \ performing an action such as clicking on a link.\nThis CSRF vulnerability can\
    \ also be exploited to achieve PHP Object Injection due to the use of unserialize()\
    \ on the user supplied file contents.\n"
