  description: The All-In-One Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive
    Data Exposure in versions up to, and including, 5.1.2. This is due to the plugin
    allowing administrators to upload backups to publicly accessible folders for restoring
    purposes. While under normal use these files would be deleted as part of the restore
    process, it is possible they are left behind when the restore is abandoned. This
    could allow unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive user or configuration
    data under rare circumstances in certain server configurations.
