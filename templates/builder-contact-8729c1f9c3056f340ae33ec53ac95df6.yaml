  description: 'The Contact Builder by Themify plugin is vulnerable to email injection
    in versions up to, and including 1.4.5. This makes it possible for attackers to
    forward contact form submissions as a "copy" to the contact-email supplied even
    when the setting is disabled. In addition, the contact-message does not do any
    input sanitization allowing HTML to be injected into the message content. This
    was being actively exploited to craft phishing emails and sending those via the
    vulnerable sites.
