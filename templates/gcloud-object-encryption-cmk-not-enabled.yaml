  description: 'Ensure that your Google Cloud Storage data is encrypted at rest using
    Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) to maintain full control over your data encryption
    and decryption processes. CMKs can be managed with the Cloud Key Management Service
    (Cloud KMS).

    '
  impact: 'Without CMK encryption, you lose the ability to manage key rotation, encryption
    policies, and data access, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized
    access.
