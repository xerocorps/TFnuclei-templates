    cvss-metrics: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    cvss-score: 7.2
  description: 'The WP Custom Admin Interface plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
    PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 7.28, via deserialization
    of untrusted input in the northernbeacheswebsites_information and wp_custom_admin_interface_import_settings
    functions. This allows administrator-level attackers to inject a PHP Object. No
    POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an
    additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
    attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
    The vulnerability is patched by setting allowed_classes. While this makes the
    vulnerability more or less unexploitable, PHP recommends not passing untrusted
    input to the unserialize function.
